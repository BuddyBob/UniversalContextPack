ased on my analysis of your codebase, here are the key weaknesses I've identified that could cause issues with 40 concurrent users:

ðŸš¨ Critical Weaknesses for 40 Concurrent Users
1. Sequential OpenAI Processing (Major Bottleneck)
Your OpenAI processing is completely sequential - one chunk at a time per user:

Impact: With 40 users each processing 10-20 chunks, you'll have 400-800 sequential OpenAI calls. This could take hours.

Solution: Implement concurrent chunk processing with semaphore limits:

2. No Connection Pooling
Your Supabase client is created once globally without connection pooling configuration:

Impact: 40 concurrent users will overwhelm database connections.

Solution: Configure connection pooling and timeouts:

3. Memory-Intensive R2 Operations
You're loading entire files into memory for R2 uploads/downloads:

Impact: 40 users uploading large files simultaneously could cause OOM errors.

4. Inefficient Progress Polling
Frontend polls every few seconds for all users:

Impact: 40 users Ã— frequent polling = database overload.

5. No Rate Limiting for Core Operations
You only have rate limiting for payments, not for analysis requests:

Impact: Users could spam analysis requests.

6. Single OpenAI API Key
All users share one OpenAI API key without rate limit management:

Impact: OpenAI rate limits will affect all users simultaneously.

ðŸ’¡ Recommended Fixes for 40 Concurrent Users
Immediate Priority (Critical)
Implement Concurrent Chunk Processing:
Add Analysis Rate Limiting:
Implement Request Queuing:
Medium Priority
Optimize Database Queries - Use database functions instead of multiple calls
Implement Caching - Cache user profiles and payment status
Add Monitoring - Track concurrent users and system resources
Long-term (Architecture)
Consider Background Job Queue (Celery/Redis)
Implement Load Balancing
Database Read Replicas for heavy read operations
ðŸŽ¯ Current Capacity Assessment
Current State: Your system can likely handle 5-8 concurrent users comfortably.

With Immediate Fixes: Could handle 20-30 concurrent users.

With Full Optimization: Could handle 40+ concurrent users.

The biggest bottleneck is the sequential OpenAI processing. Fix that first, and you'll see dramatic improvements in concurrent user capacity.
