# Webhook Debugging Summary

## Problem
Users purchasing the $3.99 unlimited plan but not receiving unlimited access. Webhook events are being received but unlimited access is not being granted.

## Enhanced Debugging Features Added

### 1. Comprehensive Webhook Logging
- Added webhook ID tracking with `[webhook_id]` in all log messages
- Enhanced `checkout.session.completed` handler with detailed session analysis
- Added support for multiple payment statuses (`paid`, `complete`)
- Improved metadata extraction and validation
- Added session object inspection when payment status is unexpected

### 2. Multiple Event Handlers
- `payment_intent.created`: Basic logging for payment initiation
- `payment_intent.succeeded`: Backup processing when checkout session fails
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`: For subscription payments (if applicable)
- Enhanced error handling and event type detection

### 3. Fallback Processing
- `payment_intent.succeeded` handler retrieves checkout session and processes metadata
- Manual database fallback in `grant_unlimited_access()` function
- Multiple retry mechanisms for database operations

### 4. Debug Endpoints

#### `/api/debug/test-unlimited-webhook` (POST)
```json
{
  "user_id": "optional-user-id",
  "amount": 3.99,
  "session_id": "optional-session-id"
}
```
Tests the unlimited access granting function directly.

#### `/api/debug/simulate-checkout` (POST)
```json
{
  "user_id": "optional-user-id", 
  "unlimited": true,
  "credits": 0
}
```
Simulates a complete checkout session with full webhook processing.

#### `/api/debug/webhook-events` (GET)
Returns recent webhook events from database logs or Stripe API.

### 5. Enhanced Database Function
Updated `grant_unlimited_access()` with:
- Better error logging and handling
- Manual SQL fallback when Supabase function fails
- Verification queries after each operation
- Multiple retry attempts

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Immediate Tests
1. Test current webhook handler with simulation:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/debug/simulate-checkout" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"unlimited": true}'
   ```

2. Test direct unlimited access grant:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://your-domain.com/api/debug/test-unlimited-webhook" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"user_id": "test-user-id"}'
   ```

3. Check recent webhook events:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/debug/webhook-events" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

### 2. Real Purchase Test
1. Make a test purchase with the $3.99 unlimited plan
2. Monitor backend logs for webhook events
3. Check for these specific log messages:
   - `🛒 [webhook_id] Checkout session completed`
   - `🌟 [webhook_id] Processing UNLIMITED purchase`
   - `✅ [webhook_id] Granted unlimited access`

### 3. Database Verification
1. Deploy the `fix_unlimited_function.sql` to Supabase
2. Verify the user's `payment_plan` is set to 'unlimited'
3. Check `subscription_status` is 'active'
4. Confirm `credits_balance` is set to 4 (new default)

## Most Likely Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Stripe Webhook Configuration
**Problem**: Webhook endpoint not configured to send `checkout.session.completed` events
**Solution**: Check Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks → Add `checkout.session.completed` to events

### Issue 2: Metadata Not Passed
**Problem**: Frontend not passing `unlimited: "true"` in checkout session metadata
**Solution**: Check `pricing-client.tsx` Stripe checkout configuration

### Issue 3: Database Function Failure
**Problem**: `grant_unlimited_access()` function failing in Supabase
**Solution**: Deploy `fix_unlimited_function.sql` and use manual fallback

### Issue 4: Webhook Endpoint Issues
**Problem**: Multiple webhook endpoints causing duplicates or failures
**Solution**: Consolidate to single endpoint `/api/stripe-webhook`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy enhanced backend** with all the debugging improvements
2. **Deploy database fixes** from `fix_unlimited_function.sql`
3. **Test with simulation endpoints** to verify logic works
4. **Make a real test purchase** and monitor logs
5. **Check Stripe webhook configuration** to ensure events are being sent
6. **Verify frontend metadata** is being passed correctly

## Log Messages to Watch For

### Success Flow:
```
🎯 [abc123] Processing webhook event: checkout.session.completed
🛒 [abc123] Checkout session completed: cs_test_...
🛒 [abc123] Payment status: paid
🛒 [abc123] Parsed - unlimited: true
🌟 [abc123] Processing UNLIMITED purchase for user [user_id]
✅ [abc123] Granted unlimited access to user [user_id]
```

### Failure Indicators:
```
❌ [abc123] Missing user_id in metadata
⚠️ [abc123] Session completed but payment status is 'unpaid'
❌ [abc123] Invalid purchase: unlimited=false, credits=0
❌ Failed to grant unlimited access: [error details]
```

This comprehensive debugging setup should help identify exactly where the unlimited purchase flow is failing.
