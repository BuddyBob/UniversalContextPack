2710. 49421. Your markup is missing the closing `</table>` tag (and `</div>` isn‚Äôt closed), which is probably throwing off your layout. Let‚Äôs fix the HTML and add a bit of minimal styling so it renders cleanly: ```html <!-- Events Table --> <div class="card"> <h2 class="card-title">üìã Event Timeline</h2> <div class="table-container"> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Time</th> <th>Type</th> <th>Details</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> {% for e in events %} <tr> <td>{{ e.time }}</td> <td>{{ e.type }}</td> <td> {% if e.question_id %} Q#{{ e.question_id }} ‚Üí {{ e.answer }} {% elif e.key %} Key ‚Äú{{ e.key }}‚Äù {% if e.meta %}(Meta){% endif %} {% if e.ctrl %}(Ctrl){% endif %} {% if e.shift %}(Shift){% endif %} {% if e.alt %}(Alt){% endif %} {% else %} ‚Äî {% endif %} </td> </tr> {% endfor %} </tbody> </table> </div> </div> ``` And add this CSS (either in your main stylesheet or inside a `<style>` block) to give it some structure: ```css .card { background: white; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1rem; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-top: 2rem; } .card-title { margin-bottom: 1rem; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; } .table-container { overflow-x: auto; } .table-container table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; } .table-container th, .table-container td { padding: 0.75rem 1rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e2e8f0; text-align: left; } .table-container th { background: #f1f5f9; font-weight: 500; } .table-container tr:last-child td { border-bottom: none; } ``` **What this does:** - **Closes** the missing `</table>` and `</div>`. - Wraps the table in a `.table-container` for horizontal scrolling. - Styles the `.card`, header, and table cells for a clean look. Now your event timeline will render as a nicely formatted table inside a card, with clear columns and consistent spacing.

2712. 49423. It looks like the login button might be inside a section but without a `type="button"`, which could cause it to submit the form by default. But I don't see a form tag, so that might cause the page to reload. The issue may lie in the click listener, which should intercept, but there's also something with the CSP script-src and how modules are handled. The script `renderer.js` runs fine using `type="module"`. It seems like everything else, like the DOMContentLoaded handler and the button click, should work.

2713. 49424. Evaluating login button issue

2714. 49425. The login button might not be working due to a few potential issues. First, there might be a conflict with the variable `$` inside the module scope of the renderer.js, but it's unlikely. Also, maybe the button isn't clickable due to CSS issues or markup problems, but that seems less likely. The login function could be misconfigured or the button's event listener might not be bound correctly. Another possibility is issues with `window.electronAPI` or incorrect fetch URL for the backend. I'll need to confirm the button's event bindings and the proper script execution order.

2715. 49426. Troubleshooting login button

2716. 49427. Nothing in your CSS would disable that button‚Äîso this almost certainly comes down to a JavaScript load or runtime error that‚Äôs preventing your `renderer.js` from ever attaching the click handler. Here‚Äôs a quick checklist to get it working again:

2717. ## 1. Verify that `renderer.js` is actually loading 1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab 2. Refresh the page and look for `renderer.js` in the list. - **If it‚Äôs missing or 404**, your `<script src="./renderer.js">` path is wrong. - **Fix:** adjust to the correct relative path (for example, `src="static/renderer.js"` or wherever it lives).

2718. ## 2. Check the console for errors Open DevTools ‚Üí Console. Look for any **SyntaxError** or **TypeError** early on. If your module has a stray typo, **none** of the code (including the login-click binding) will ever run.

2719. ## 3. Move your module tag to the bottom of the `<body>` Just to be sure you‚Äôre not racing DOMContentLoaded, place: ```html <!-- ‚Ä¶ your inline helper script ‚Ä¶ --> <!-- renderer.js should be last --> <script type="module" src="./renderer.js"></script> </body> </html> ``` Module scripts are deferred, but if your HTML structure changed, moving it down guarantees your `<button id="loginBtn">` exists before the import.

2720. ## 4. Temporarily add a quick sanity‚Äêcheck At the top of **renderer.js**, insert: ```js console.log("‚úÖ renderer.js loaded, binding loginBtn

2721. "); ``` Then at the end of your `window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ‚Ä¶)`, add: ```js console.log("Binding login click to", $('loginBtn')); ``` Reload ‚Üí watch the console. - If you see both logs, the file loaded and your `$()` found the button. - If you don‚Äôt see them, the module never ran.

2722. ## 5. Ensure your login function actually fires Finally, inside your `login()` function, put: ```js async function login() { console.log("üî• login() called"); // ‚Ä¶ rest of code ‚Ä¶ } ``` Click the ‚Äúüîë Sign In‚Äù button. - If you **do** see `"üî• login() called"`, your binding is working but the fetch is silently failing (check network tab and catch blocks). - If you **don‚Äôt**, the click handler isn‚Äôt bound.

2723. Fixing whichever of those steps fails will get your sign-in button talking to the server again.

2724. 49428. renderer.js:192 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'onclick') at renderer.js:192:22

2725. 49429. 94cb4bea4bef1732-SJC

2726. 49430. The error "Cannot set properties of null" suggests the element with id "loginBtn" isn't being found when the script runs. The DOM may have been altered, or the script order could be causing the issue. It seems like the "renderer.js" file is loaded before the inline helper script. This could explain why the element isn't available at runtime. I'll need to double-check the order in which the scripts are included, ensuring the correct setup for the DOM manipulation.

2727. 49431. Investigating DOM error

2728. 49432. That error means you‚Äôre doing something like: ```js document.getElementById('exitBtn').onclick = ‚Ä¶ ``` but there is **no** `<button id="exitBtn">` in your new HTML, so `getElementById('exitBtn')` returns `null` and you try to set `.onclick` on it. You have two quick fixes:

2729. ### 1. Remove or guard the `exitBtn` binding In **renderer.js**, find: ```js $('exitBtn').onclick = () => window.proctorAPI?.requestExit(); ``` Either **delete** that line entirely if you no longer need an exit button, or change it to: ```js const exitBtn = $('exitBtn'); if (exitBtn) { exitBtn.onclick = () => window.proctorAPI?.requestExit(); } ```

2730. ### 2. Add the missing button back into your HTML If you _do_ want an Exit button, put this somewhere in your body: ```html <button id="exitBtn" class="btn btn-secondary">Exit</button> ``` That way `$('exitBtn')` will find an element and your script won‚Äôt blow up.

2731. Either option will prevent the ‚ÄúCannot set properties of null‚Äù error so your code can continue and your Login/Sign-In button will bind and start sending its fetch again.

2732. 49433. 94cb53b93d161732-SJC

2733. 49434. Addressing lock mode after verification

2734. 49435. You never actually hide your old login/join/verify UI once you‚Äôve finished the face‚Äêcheck, so it all stays on screen. The easiest way to ‚Äúlock down‚Äù the app after success is to: 1. **Wrap each of your three pre‚Äêtest sections in a predictable container** (give them `id`s): ```html <section id="loginSection" class="section">‚Ä¶</section> <section id="joinArea" class="section hidden-section">‚Ä¶</section> <section id="faceSection" class="section hidden-section">‚Ä¶</section> ``` 2. **Listen** for your `verificationComplete` event in your inline script and hide them all, then show your questions: ```js window.addEventListener('verificationComplete', () => { // hide everything pre-test hideSection('loginSection'); hideSection('joinArea'); hideSection('faceSection'); // show the test questions showSection('questionsContainer'); updateResponseMessage('', 'info'); fetchQuestions(); }); ``` 3. **Ensure** your helper functions `showSection()` and `hideSection()` (you already defined them) are in scope before you fire them: ```js window.showSection = id => { const el = document.getElementById(id); if (el) el.classList.remove('hidden-section'); }; window.hideSection = id => { const el = document.getElementById(id); if (el) el.classList.add('hidden-section'); }; ``` That way, as soon as face‚Äêverification completes (and you `dispatchEvent('verificationComplete')` in your `verifyFace.js`), the login/join/verify buttons disappear and only your test UI remains.

2735. #### A note on the ‚ÄúX‚Äù window-close button If you still want to let the student exit the kiosk, you can re-enable your Exit button by adding: ```html <button id="exitBtn" class="btn btn-danger">Exit</button> ``` somewhere (for instance in that login section). Then in `renderer.js`: ```js const exitBtn = document.getElementById('exitBtn'); if (exitBtn) exitBtn.onclick = () => window.electronAPI.requestExit(); ``` That gives you both a soft ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù of the web UI **and** a way to fully close the app via the Exit button.

2736. 49436. const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ width: 1920, height: 1080, kiosk: false, frame: true, alwaysOnTop: true, skipTaskbar: true, webPreferences: { webSecurity: false, preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'), // Use path.join for better cross-platform compatibility nodeIntegration: false, contextIsolation: true } }); anything I should add in main.js to make it more secure for test takes

2737. 49437. 94cb59a07cc21732-SJC

2738. 49438. Here are a few quick wins you can apply in your **main.js** when you create your `BrowserWindow` to lock things down even further during a high-stakes test: ```js const mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ width: 1920, height: 1080, kiosk: false, // you can switch to true once verification completes frame: false, // removes the standard window controls autoHideMenuBar: true, // never show the menu bar alwaysOnTop: true, skipTaskbar: true, fullscreenable: false, // disable F11 toggling enableRemoteModule: false, webPreferences: { webSecurity: true, // enforce CSP, same‚Äêorigin, etc. preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js'), contextIsolation: true, nodeIntegration: false, sandbox: true, // run renderer in a sandbox } }); ``` Then, after you‚Äôve verified the student‚Äôs face, you can switch **into kiosk mode** and recast your window so they can‚Äôt Alt+Tab out, close, or mess with menus: ```js ipcMain.on('lockdown', () => { mainWindow.setKiosk(true); mainWindow.setAlwaysOnTop(true, 'screen-saver'); // really lock it on top mainWindow.setFullScreen(true); mainWindow.setMenuBarVisibility(false); }); ``` And on your renderer side, once you detect `verification_complete`, dispatch: ```js window.electronAPI.send('lockdown'); ``` Finally, to stop any errant pop-ups or navigations: ```js // block any new windows from window.open or target="_blank" mainWindow.webContents.setWindowOpenHandler(() => ({ action: 'deny' })); // prevent navigation to any external pages mainWindow.webContents.on('will-navigate', e => e.preventDefault()); ``` ‚Äî together these measures: 1. **Remove all window controls** (no close/minimize buttons) 2. **Hide menus** (no ‚ÄúView ‚Üí Developer Tools‚Äù) 3. **Enforce full-screen kiosk** once unlocked 4. **Block external navigations & pop-ups** 5. **Run the renderer in a sandbox** with no Node integration That will give you a true lockdown environment for test-taking.

2743. 49443. It seems like after passing verification, no questions appear, likely because the `fetchQuestions` function isn't being called, or the `questionsContainer` is hidden. I‚Äôll make sure to fire the event and listen for it in `render.js` by adding an event listener for `verification

2744. 49444. Troubleshooting question display issue

2745. 49445. After face‚Äêverification completes you‚Äôre dispatching the `verificationComplete` event, but you never actually show your questions UI (or call `fetchQuestions()`) in response to it. That‚Äôs why you see the ‚ÄúAssigned Test‚Ä¶‚Äù line but no question list. ### 1) In your **verifyFace.js** make sure you dispatch the event **before** you `return;` ```js // ‚Ä¶ inside processFrame(), when you detect r.verification_complete ‚Ä¶ if (r.verification_complete) { // stop the camera, hide the section, etc. window.dispatchEvent(new Event('verificationComplete')); return; } ``` *(It looks like you already have this‚Äîjust double-check that it fires.)*

2746. ### 2) In **renderer.js**, listen for that event and then: - Hide all pre-test sections (login/join/verify) - Show the questions container - Clear any face-verify messages - Call `fetchQuestions()` At the bottom of your `renderer.js` (after your `DOMContentLoaded` block), add: ```js window.addEventListener('verificationComplete', () => { // hide the pre-test flows hideSection('loginSection'); hideSection('joinArea'); hideSection('faceSection'); // clear any leftover messages updateResponseMessage(''); // show and load questions showSection('questionsContainer'); fetchQuestions(); }); ``` Make sure your HTML has those exact IDs on the three pre-test sections: ```html <section id="loginSection" class="section">‚Ä¶</section> <section id="joinArea" class="section hidden-section">‚Ä¶</section> <section id="faceSection" class="section hidden-section">‚Ä¶</section> <!-- and your questions container stays hidden until then: --> <section id="questionsContainer" class="section hidden-section">‚Ä¶</section> ``` and that your helper functions (`showSection()`, `hideSection()`, `updateResponseMessage()`) are declared **before** this listener.

2747. With that in place, as soon as face-verification succeeds you will ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù the login/join/verify UI and immediately load & display the question list.

2752. 49450. It looks like the user is still seeing the login section after verification, even though the "Assigned Test" is displayed. This suggests they didn't hide the login section properly. Based on the

2753. 49451. Addressing sign-in visibility

2754. 49452. The reason you‚Äôre still seeing the login UI is that you never actually hid it‚Äîyour ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù logic is only hiding `joinArea` and `faceSection`, but your login form lives in a plain `<section class="section">` without an ID, so `hideSection('loginSection')` does nothing. ### 1) Give your login section an ID In your HTML, change this: ```diff - <!-- Login Section --> - <section class="section"> + <!-- Login Section --> + <section id="loginSection" class="section"> ``` ### 2) Hook up the `verificationComplete` listener to hide it In your **renderer.js**, after you define `showSection` / `hideSection`, add: ```js window.addEventListener('verificationComplete', () => { // hide everything pre-test hideSection('loginSection'); hideSection('joinArea'); hideSection('faceSection'); // clear any face-verify messages updateResponseMessage(''); // show the questions UI showSection('questionsContainer'); fetchQuestions(); }); ``` ### 3) Ensure your `questionsContainer` is initially hidden In your HTML: ```html <section id="questionsContainer" class="section hidden-section"> <!-- questions get loaded here --> </section> ```

2755. With those three changes: 1. **`#loginSection` exists**, so `hideSection('loginSection')` will actually hide the login form. 2. You also hide `joinArea` and `faceSection` as before. 3. Then show and populate your questions. Now, immediately after face-verification succeeds, the entire pre-test flow (login/join/verify) is removed and only the test questions remain.

2756. 49453. 94cb61d069511732-SJC

2757. 49454. It seems the problem arises because the `showSection` function isn't setting the `display` property for the `questionsContainer`. The missing line in the code is affecting the visibility, since the class `hidden-section` only hides the element by setting `display: none`, but doesn't handle display switching back. To fix this, I should update `showSection` to set `style.display = 'block'` and `hideSection` to set `style.display = 'none'`. Also, they seem to be calling `updateResponseMessage`, which may not be defined yet ‚Äì I could use the global version instead.

2758. 49455. Fixing display issue

2759. 49456. A couple of things are going on: 1. **Your `showSection`/`hideSection` helpers only add/remove the CSS class**, but you never actually flip the element‚Äôs `display` back on once you remove the class. 2. **Your `verificationComplete` event is only hiding the *face* section and showing the questions**, but you never hid the login (or join) section when you wired it up earlier. Here‚Äôs how to fix both at once:

2760. ### 1) Tweak your `showSection`/`hideSection` helpers In **renderer.js**, replace: ```js window.showSection = id => { const el = document.getElementById(id); if (el) el.classList.remove('hidden-section'); }; window.hideSection = id => { const el = document.getElementById(id); if (el) el.classList.add('hidden-section'); }; ``` with: ```js window.showSection = id => { const el = document.getElementById(id); if (!el) return; el.classList.remove('hidden-section'); el.style.display = ''; // let it fall back to CSS display }; window.hideSection = id => { const el = document.getElementById(id); if (!el) return; el.classList.add('hidden-section'); el.style.display = 'none'; }; ``` This makes sure that when you ‚Äúun-hide‚Äù something you also reset its `display` (so it actually shows).

2761. ### 2) Hide the login/join UI on `verificationComplete` Still in **renderer.js**, make your listener look like this: ```js window.addEventListener('verificationComplete', () => { // 1) tear down *all* the pre-test steps hideSection('loginSection'); hideSection('joinArea'); hideSection('faceSection'); // 2) clear any messages updateResponseMessage(''); // 3) show the questions and kick off loading showSection('questionsContainer'); fetchQuestions(); }); ``` > **Note:** you also need to give your login `<section>` an ID (`id="loginSection"`) in your HTML.

2762. ### 3) Make sure your sections start out hidden/displayed correctly In **index.html**: ```html <section id="loginSection" class="section"> ‚Ä¶ </section> <section id="joinArea" class="section hidden-section"> ‚Ä¶ </section> <section id="faceSection" class="section hidden-section"> ‚Ä¶ </section> <section id="questionsContainer" class="section hidden-section"> <!-- questions here --> </section> ``` With those three changes: - Clicking **Sign In** ‚Üí face-verify flows are shown. - Once face-verify dispatches `verificationComplete`, you tear down **login**, **join**, **face** sections. - You then show **questionsContainer**, and because your `showSection` forces `display` back on, your questions will appear. Let me know if you still see no questions after that‚Äîwe can then verify that `fetchQuestions()` is actually hitting your `/student/questions/

2763. ` endpoint.

2768. 49461. It seems the user's issue stems from the 'verificationComplete' event not firing, likely because the event dispatch code was missing. I suggest updating `verifyFace.js` to dispatch the event inside the `processFrame` function when `r.verification_complete` is true. Also, adding a guard for the `verificationFinished` flag will prevent recursion after returning from `processFrame`. Additionally, in `renderer.js`, make sure the listener correctly triggers `startVerification` and handles the visibility of the login section.

2772. 49464. 94cb682bafd51732-SJC

2773. 49465. It looks like the 500 server error might be caused by a misconfiguration. The login endpoint could be returning an HTML page instead of JSON, which is what the fetch function is expecting. The error "Unexpected token '<'" suggests it‚Äôs receiving HTML. The function seems to be returning a rendered template when it should return JSON. I'll need to check the code, verifying how row data is handled ‚Äî it could be causing the exception if `row` is `None` and getting accessed inappropriately.

2775. 49467. 94cb6a05080a7aeb-SJC

2776. 49468. It seems like the bug occurs after login success, where the face verification section isn‚Äôt being shown. The issue is that the 'hidden-section' class on faceSection hasn't been removed. In the function enableFaceSection, they correctly set `element.hidden = false`, but the class itself still hides the section with `display: none`. I‚Äôll need to modify enableFaceSection to remove the 'hidden-section' class. Also, the verifyBtn‚Äôs disabled state needs to be updated. After login, though, loginSection isn‚Äôt hidden, which looks fine, but faceSection needs better handling.

2777. 49469. Fixing UI bug

2778. 49470. `enableFaceSection()` only flips the `hidden` attribute, but in the new HTML every ‚Äúwizard‚Äù section is hidden with the **CSS class** `hidden-section` ( `display:none`) as well. Because that class is never removed, the face-verification block stays invisible, the user never clicks **Start Verification**, and the whole flow stops there ‚Äî no camera, no `/api/compare`, no questions. ```text <section id="faceSection" class="section hidden-section"> ‚Ä¶ </section> ‚Üë this is still there ```

2779. ### 1. Fix `enableFaceSection` ```js function enableFaceSection () { const faceSec = $('faceSection'); const verifyBtn = $('verifyBtn'); /* ‚îÄ‚îÄ reveal the section ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ */ faceSec.classList.remove('hidden-section'); // remove utility class faceSec.style.display = 'block'; // or '' if you prefer faceSec.hidden = false; // keep attribute in sync /* ‚îÄ‚îÄ arm the ‚ÄúStart Verification‚Äù button only once ‚îÄ‚îÄ */ if (verifyBtn.disabled) { verifyBtn.disabled = false; verifyBtn.addEventListener( 'click', () => { if (!window.userId) { ui.msg('Missing student ID; log in again'); return; } $('videoContainer').hidden = false; verifyBtn.disabled = true; // lock the button startVerification(); // üöÄ kick off live feed }, { once: true } ); } } ``` (You can delete the `faceSection.hidden = true;` line in the `DOMContentLoaded` handler because the CSS class already hides it.)

2780. ### 2. Optional: make the helpers consistent If you want every show/hide call to work the same way, centralise it: ```js window.showSection = id => { const el = $(id); if (!el) return; el.classList.remove('hidden-section'); el.hidden = false; el.style.display = 'block'; }; window.hideSection = id => { const el = $(id); if (!el) return; el.classList.add('hidden-section'); el.hidden = true; el.style.display = 'none'; }; ```

2781. ### 3. What happens now? 1. **Login** returns `status: "ok"` ‚áí `enableFaceSection()` runs. 2. The face-verification block becomes visible; the ‚ÄúStart Verification‚Äù button is enabled. 3. The student clicks it ‚Üí `startVerification()` streams frames, your backend replies, and fires the global `verificationComplete` event. 4. The listener hides *all* pre-test UI and calls `fetchQuestions()` ‚Äì questions finally appear. No back-end changes required.

2785. 49474. 94cb6d957a7e7aeb-SJC

2786. 49475. It seems like the issue may be related to conflicting display settings on the `questionsContainer`. Initially, it‚Äôs hidden with the class 'hidden-section', and we later try to show it by removing the class and setting `display = ''`. The problem is that we also set `questionsContainer.style.display = 'none'` earlier‚Äîthis might be affecting how it shows up after the class is removed. We might also be getting a 404 error if `window.assignedId` is invalid. It‚Äôs worth checking that `fetchQuestions` properly gets data.

2788. 49477. It seems like the issue might be that the "Loading questions

2803. 49491. It looks like the issue is that after the student logs in, the script tries to access `updateResponseMessage`, but it's not accessible globally because the renderer.js runs in a module scope. In the inline script, `updateResponseMessage` was defined in `window`, but in renderer.js, I need to reference it as `window.updateResponseMessage`. This mistake causes a `ReferenceError`, breaking the flow after the `verificationComplete` event and preventing further parts of the code from running.

2805. 49493. **Why the question list never renders** 1. The face-verify loop fires the custom event **`verificationComplete`** 2.

Because `renderer.js` is loaded as an **ES module**, the name `updateResponseMessage` is looked up in the module‚Äôs own scope first. It is **not** found (you attached it to `window` in the inline `<script>` of *index.html*), so a ``` Uncaught ReferenceError: updateResponseMessage is not defined ``` is thrown. 4. When an exception is thrown, the rest of the handler (`showSection('questionsContainer'); fetchQuestions();`) is **never executed** ‚Äì hence no questions.

2806. ### Quick fix ‚Äì one-line patch in *renderer.js* ```diff window.addEventListener('verificationComplete', () => { hideSection('loginSection'); hideSection('joinArea'); hideSection('faceSection'); - updateResponseMessage(''); // throws! + window.updateResponseMessage(''); // safe ‚Äì lives on the global object showSection('questionsContainer'); fetchQuestions(); }); ``` That‚Äôs it ‚Äì the handler now completes, `fetchQuestions()` is called, and the questions appear.

2807. ### (Optional) make it impossible to hit this class of bug again * Always reference helpers attached in `index.html` via `window.` in module files: ```js window.showSection(‚Ä¶) window.hideSection(‚Ä¶) window.updateResponseMessage(‚Ä¶) ``` * Or, import what you need instead of relying on globals. * Add a global error listener during development so silent crashes are obvious: ```js window.addEventListener('error', e => console.error('Global error', e)); window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', e => console.error('Unhandled promise', e.reason)); ``` After the one-line fix above, log in again ‚Äì the face-ID flow will hide all pre-test UI and the question card(s) will render for the student.

2811. 49497. 94ca18ffbe0922ba-SJC

2812. 49498. The user needs to integrate a "verify face" button into their Electron app, ensuring it only activates once the user successfully joins using a join code. I'd need to modify the HTML, renderer.js, and possibly hook into the join code validation process. My guess is that the button should be disabled until they join, and then enable it while starting the camera once clicked. The existing fiddle script could help guide this integration. I'll focus on how to trigger the button to enable after code validation!

2813. 49499. Integrating face verification

2814. 49500. The goal is to restructure the face verification process so the button appears disabled initially and only activates once the user successfully joins via the join code. Steps would include: 1. Modify HTML to add a disabled `verifyBtn`. 2. Ensure the button enables after a successful join code entry. 3. Delay camera initialization until the button is clicked. 4. Handle camera reopening by disabling the button after it's clicked. 5. Modify `renderer.js` to handle IPC interaction and enable the button during join code validation. We'll also need to place DOM elements like the video and progress bar in the proper sections.

2816. 49502. It looks like there‚Äôs a mismatch of parentheses in the `startVerification()` function. The function needs to close with `}` instead of `});`, as that ending suggests an extra event listener. The `startVerification()` function already calls `initCamera()` inside, so the `});` after it isn‚Äôt necessary. To fix the script, I‚Äôll remove the extra `});` and ensure that only one closure with `}` remains to properly end the function. This should correct any syntax errors and ensure proper flow.

2817. 49503. Fixing JavaScript syntax

2818. 49504. The issue in `verifyFace.js` is that the `startVerification()` function has an extra `});`. Inside the function, `initCamera();` finishes, and the function should close only with `}`. The `});` appears to be a leftover from the previous DOMContentLoaded wrapper, which shouldn't be there anymore. To fix it: ```javascript export function startVerification() { // Define video element and other functions const video = document.getElementById('video'); //

2819. other code

2820. initCamera(); } ``` This will cleanly export the `startVerification()` function and fix the syntax.

2827. 49511. It seems like the user has a server running on localhost at port 5001, while their friend‚Äôs server is on port 5300 (probably at the IP address 192.168.64.159). They‚Äôre asking if they need to specify a port "300", which might refer to port 3000 or something related. To answer: - If both servers should be reachable, the CSP rule should include both host/port pairs. - The tag already allows requests to 192.168.64

2830. 49514. The user wants to restructure a Flask app used for proctoring/testing. When a teacher creates an account, they should also create student usernames and passwords. The teacher would act as an admin and create student credentials. On the Electron side, students ‚Äì who cannot register themselves ‚Äì will log in with the credentials provided by their teacher. Additionally, teachers need to provide an ID photo for face verification during account creation. We also need to disable the student registration endpoint.

2834. 49518. The update here seems focused on removing the registration features from the UI since students should not be able to register now. The plan should include disabling or hiding the registration button and updating the auth function to only handle login. I'd want to make sure that the join test only happens after a successful login and make sure the face verification doesn‚Äôt happen too early. If there's anything related to 'register,' that must be removed or disabled, potentially with an alert about registration being disabled.

2836. 49520. 94ca46a8ee53cfbc-SJC

2837. 49521. It looks like for the new requirements, we need to add a `photo` column to the `student` table to store the ID photo path. As they suggested, we may need to include face verification, which might expand to a one-to-many relationship for face encodings, but for now the `photo` column is sufficient. Since hashed passwords are already handled and the student registration endpoint changes don‚Äôt require a DB update, I‚Äôll just focus on adding that new column. I can provide guidance on running a migration for this update.

2843. 49527. To show **which tests are currently assigned** to each student, update your route to **query assignments** and group them by student. Then update the template to display them inline.

2844. ## ‚úÖ 1. Update the Flask route (admin dashboard) In `@app.route('/admin')`: ```python @app.route('/admin') @admin_required def admin_dashboard(): tests = query_db('SELECT * FROM test ORDER BY id DESC') students = query_db('SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY id DESC') # fetch all current assignments (not finished) assigned = query_db(''' SELECT a.student_id, t.title FROM assigned a JOIN test t ON t.id = a.test_id WHERE a.finished_at IS NULL ''') # group tests by student_id assigned_map = {} for row in assigned: assigned_map.setdefault(row['student_id'], []).append(row['title']) return render_template('admin_dashboard.html', students=students, tests=tests, assigned_map=assigned_map) ```

2845. ## ‚úÖ 2. Update your `admin_dashboard.html` template Update the loop like this: ```jinja2 <ul> {% for s in students %} <li> <strong>{{ s.username }}</strong> {% if assigned_map[s.id] %} ‚Äî Assigned: {{ assigned_map[s.id] | join(', ') }} {% else %} ‚Äî No active test {% endif %} [<a href="{{ url_for('assign_test') }}">Assign Test</a>] </li> {% endfor %} </ul> ```

2846. ### ‚úÖ Output Example: ``` ‚Ä¢ alice ‚Äî Assigned: Math Final, Physics Quiz [Assign Test] ‚Ä¢ bob ‚Äî No active test [Assign Test] ``` This shows the student list along with their currently active assignments, and avoids showing finished ones.
