They advocate for modular, testable patches, global/window\u2011based helpers in conjunction with ES modules, and a strong emphasis on security hardening (CSP, kiosk, blocking navigation). They also outline administrative workflow changes (disable registration, admin dashboard enhancements, student photo storage) to support a teacher/admin\u2011driven model. The UCP assembled above captures these facets across persona, behavior, technical domains, project patterns, evolution timeline, and interaction style.",
