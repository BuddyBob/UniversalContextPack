2806. ### üöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What *Enduro* Means in Mountain Biking: | Feature | Description | |

2807. | | **Focus** | Fast, aggressive downhill riding **with some uphill pedaling** | **Terrain** | Steep, rocky, technical descents ‚Äî plus climbs to reach the top | **Races** | Timed **downhill stages**, untimed uphill transfers | **Bike Type** | Full-suspension, long-travel (~150‚Äì180mm), very capable downhill but not too heavy to climb

2808. ### üîÅ Enduro vs. Other Styles | Style | Suspension Travel | Climbs Well? | Descends Well? | Example Use | |
