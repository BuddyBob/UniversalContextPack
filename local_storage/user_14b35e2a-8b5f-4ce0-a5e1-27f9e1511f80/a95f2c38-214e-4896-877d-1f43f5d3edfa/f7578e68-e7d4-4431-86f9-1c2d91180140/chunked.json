AI also eases the demographic and application management challenges faced by colleges.

In 2010, Walter Chen and Rodrigo Guzman created IDoneThis, a productivity tool that let users record their daily accomplishments and receive summaries, aiming to boost motivation by highlighting completed tasks. However, when users requested more features, the founders added to-do lists, only to find that many tasks remained unfinished. Analysis revealed that people often failed to complete planned tasks and moved quickly on impromptu ones. This highlighted the inefficacy of to-do lists, as users felt overwhelmed and often abandoned them. Developers of task management software face challenges; their tools offer ways to write down, organize, and prioritize tasks but seldom lead to increased productivity. Psychological studies, such as the Zeigarnik effect, explain why unfinished tasks preoccupy our minds. Alternatives like time blocking, though suggested, also present challenges. Ultimately, the persistence of uncompleted tasks reflects deeper issues in how we manage time and the high expectations we set for ourselves, leading to a cycle of productivity app usage often ending in failure to achieve their intended goals.\n\n23230. Production blocking\n\n23231. Here are **three fresh, non-essay ideas** targeting real-world problems with little direct competition\u2014remember, simpler tools often win when they address overlooked friction \ud83c\udf43\n\n## 1. **Async Brainstorm Buddy** **Problem:** Group brainstorming sessions suffer from *production blocking*\u2014only one person can contribute at a time, and dominant voices overshadow quieter participants \ue200cite\ue202turn0search21\ue201. **Solution:** A shared real-time whiteboard allowing **parallel idea capture**: participants post sticky notes or voice clips live. No gating on turn-taking. **Why it's new:** Existing tools (e.g., Miro) are heavy and geared for enterprises. A lightweight, mobile-first \u201cidea pad\u201d designed for spontaneous peer sessions (classrooms, study groups, clubs) doesn\u2019t exist. **MVP features:** - Anonymous/attributed note posting - Categorization by tags (e.g. \u201cmarketing,\u201d \u201cproject idea\u201d) - Upvote clustering + AI summary\n\n## 2. **Low-Stakes Progress Journal** **Problem:** To-do apps spark anxiety by making users feel productive just by logging tasks, leading to guilt when tasks aren\u2019t completed \ue200cite\ue202turn0news20\ue201. **Solution:** A \u201cprogress + reflection micro-journal\u201d: users jot down one \u201cToday I did\u2026\u201d (100 characters) and one \u201cTomorrow I want to\u2026\u201d **Why it\u2019s unique:** Unlike task managers, this app reinforces small wins and builds habits through positive reinforcement\u2014not productivity stress. **MVP features:** - Daily push notifications - Weekly heat map of entries - Private, shareable streaks\n\n## 3. **Screen-Time School Scheduler** **Problem:** Students\u2019 screen/device use often disrupts academic focus\u2014but studies show *not all screen use is bad* \ue200cite\ue202turn0search10\ue202turn0search19\ue201. **Solution:** An adaptive schedule blocker that distinguishes \u201cdeep-focus\u201d study vs \u201cactive screen use\u201d (e.g., research).

Commissioners begin public meeting with lengthy closed session\n\n23265. The Mecosta County Board of Commissioners held a regular public meeting on July 17, 2025, beginning with a controversial closed session that lasted over two hours. The meeting was officially called to order at 4 p.m., but the board entered a closed session by 4:25 p.m., citing attorney-client privilege to discuss the Tonkin Drain project with their attorney, Timothy Perrone of Cohl, Stoker and Toskey PC. The board did not return to open session until around 6:40 p.m., leaving attending members of the public waiting and expressing frustration. One attendee, Dr. Rudy Bogoian, remained in the room during the closed session but declined to clarify his role, and the board chair refused comment on his presence. This raised concerns over transparency and potential violations of Michigan\u2019s Open Meetings Act, which strictly regulates who can attend closed sessions. Following the session, Perrone clarified the board's limited authority over the Tonkin Drain issue, emphasizing their control is mostly confined to budgeting and staffing of the drain commissioner\u2019s office. The meeting concluded with routine agenda items, and further coverage by The Pioneer is expected.\n\n23266. Steer your way to a top motoring career with new national programme as EVs fuel demand for new skills in sector\n\n23267. A new national Automotive Work Experience programme aims to address the pressing talent shortage in the UK\u2019s motor industry, driven by the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and advancing vehicle technologies. With a government-backed \u00a33,750 EV grant, demand for digitally skilled and future-ready professionals is rising, while the sector faces a major skills gap due to the retirement of an estimated 144,000 workers by 2032 and 17,000 current unfilled vacancies. Despite many students holding Level 2 or 3 automotive qualifications, a lack of work experience hinders employment. In response, the Institute of the Motor Industry, School of Thought Automotive, and Autotech Academy have launched a national programme providing hands-on placements to students under 16 through the IMI Jobs site. The initiative seeks to reshape outdated perceptions of the industry as outdated or \u201cdirty,\u201d particularly among youth, and highlights vast career opportunities in the high-tech automotive field. Businesses are encouraged to offer placements and will receive support materials to do so. Additionally, the article covers job opportunities at firms like Spring GDS and Kier Group, highlights volunteering prospects with Guide Dogs, and offers tips on mastering subtle cues during job interviews. The report also raises concerns that small businesses are lagging behind in upskilling for AI integration.\n\n23268. Montgomery County commissioners to move meetings to Thursdays under new state law\n\n23269. Montgomery County commissioners will shift their regular meetings to Thursdays starting January 1 in response to a new Texas state law, House Bill 1522, which extends the agenda notice requirement from 72 hours to three business days. This change is intended to increase transparency and prevent local governments from posting meeting agendas late on Fridays to obscure information from the public ahead of Monday or Tuesday meetings. The law takes effect on September 1, but the county decided to implement the schedule change beginning in the new year to align with its existing annual meeting calendar. Currently, agendas are posted on Fridays for Tuesday meetings, necessitating a mid-week posting to comply with the new law. Although Commissioner Matt Gray supported implementing the change sooner to avoid weekend preparation, the court agreed with Precinct 3 Commissioner Ritch Wheeler\u2019s recommendation to wait until January 1. First Assistant County Attorney Amy Davidson noted that transitioning beforehand would require significant procedural adjustments. The new law and schedule adjustment are expected to enhance transparency in county operations.\n\n23270. How do colleges verify volunteer hours?\n\n23271.

Fire-smart landscaping ideas - 5 ways to use non-combustible materials and special planting techniques to slow the spread of wildfires\n\n23447. With rising temperatures and extended wildfire seasons, especially in regions like California, the Western U.S., and Florida, adopting fire-smart landscaping has become crucial. This approach, known as firescaping, uses non-combustible materials and strategic planting to slow wildfires and protect properties. The article outlines five key strategies: (1) designing a consciously planned landscape with flame-resistant materials and by replacing flammable structures; (2) planting carefully with well-maintained, non-invasive, and fire-resistant vegetation; (3) zoning the yard into defensible spaces to prevent fire from reaching the home; (4) using non-organic mulch, like gravel and rocks, near homes to reduce ignition sources; and (5) selecting hardscaping materials such as bricks and stones to serve as firebreaks. These methods support creating an aesthetically pleasing, ecologically sound, and fire-resilient yard. Implementing them can help homeowners comply with evolving safety regulations, such as California\u2019s upcoming Zone 0 mandates, and ultimately mitigate the growing risks associated with climate-induced wildfires.\n\n23448.

Study: Consumers See 'Strong Value' in Streaming But Are 'Very Concerned' About Economy\n\n23628. A new study by Hub Entertainment Research reveals that while U.S. consumers are increasingly anxious about the economy\u2014especially inflation and potential recession\u2014they continue to see high value in streaming video services. Conducted in May 2025 among 3,000 U.S. viewers aged 14-74, the \"TV Advertising: Fact vs. Fiction\" report shows that streaming is among the last entertainment areas consumers would cut when reducing costs. Although nearly 90% believe subscription prices are rising more frequently, most are reluctant to cancel unless value diminishes. A growing preference for ad-supported lower-cost services is apparent, with ad intolerance dropping from 17% in 2021 to 11%. Aggregators like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Roku, and YouTube are increasingly popular, especially among younger viewers; 60% of those aged 18-34 use them. YouTube emerged as a top-value platform among both free and paid streaming options, with nearly 90% of viewers engaging with its services, including on TV screens. The study emphasizes that while viewers are cost-conscious, they still view streaming as a cost-effective entertainment option\u2014suggesting providers should be cautious with price hikes to maintain value perception and subscriber loyalty.\n\n23629. 'Global emergency' killing 100 an hour\n\n23630. Loneliness has reached crisis levels globally, with the World Health Organization declaring it a public health threat as serious as smoking or obesity. One in six people worldwide experiences profound loneliness, contributing to an estimated 100 deaths every hour\u2014approximately 900,000 annually. Particularly affected are young people, including one in four young Australians who feel isolated despite constant digital connectivity. The piece underscores that loneliness is not merely a lack of company but a pervasive sense of invisibility and disconnection, even amid social activity and online interaction. It manifests physically in inflammation, heart disease, and early mortality, and also psychologically, fostering distrust and emotional distress. The article advocates for societal change, calling for greater empathy, more open communal spaces, and authentic communication to counter this silent epidemic. It emphasizes that while digital tools can facilitate connection, they cannot replace human presence and meaningful interaction. Addressing loneliness requires small, consistent acts of recognition and inclusion, shifting from silent suffering to a culture of visible support and compassion.\n\n23631.

Seth MacFarlane, creator of \"Family Guy,\" recently ventured into filmmaking with his R-rated live-action comedy \"Ted.\" Excited about directing live actors and utilizing modern technology like CGI, he also enjoyed the freedom of a $65 million budget. Despite his success in animation, MacFarlane feels a prejudice against the medium and hopes that his film work will be seen as more significant. Ted features a slacker named John (Mark Wahlberg) whose life is disrupted by his talking teddy bear, Ted, as he forms a relationship with Lori (Mila Kunis). MacFarlane voices the irreverent bear. Despite his ambitions with Ted, MacFarlane still engages with his shows, particularly \"Family Guy,\" which remains influential and controversial for its boundary-pushing content. MacFarlane juggles multiple professional fantasies like music, acting, and producing a reboot of \"The Flintstones.\" While he enjoys material success and maintains a high profile, including his advocacy for atheism, he remains uncertain about the future of \"Family Guy\" and reflects on the challenges of balancing his various ambitions.\n\n23843.

Highlights include \"McStroke,\" where Peter suffers a burger-induced stroke; \"Stewie Loves Lois,\" featuring Stewie's realization of his mother's love; \"FOX-y Lady,\" a satire on Fox News; and \"Petarded,\" where Peter is diagnosed with intellectual disability. Episodes like \"Road to the North Pole,\" \"Blue Harvest,\" and \"And Then There Were Fewer\" display the show's ambitious storylines and comedic prowess. Standout episodes \"PTV\" and \"Back to the Pilot\" critically examine censorship and provide fans with a nostalgic look back.\n\n23845. \"Family Guy\" parodies \"Top Gun\" - beach volleyball and all - in exclusive sneak peek at new season\n\n23846.

Other characters such as Stewie and Joe play the roles of \"Iceman\" and Goose, respectively. Chris will portray Goose's son, Rooster. The episode will touch on key moments from the movie, including the death of Goose and the iconic beach volleyball scene.

The episode maintains Family Guy's classic style, but it also shows a softer side with jokes that feel more gentle than usual. The special echoes the show's understanding and willingness to grow with its faithful audience. While the characteristic cutaway gags and irreverent humor remain intact, there is a hint of self-aware, introspective comedy.

Most believe AI helps small businesses compete with larger firms\n\n24276. A recent survey by Talker Research, commissioned by ActiveCampaign, found that artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being adopted in American workplaces, particularly among business owners, marketers, and salespeople. Of the 1,000 respondents, 77% reported that using AI boosts confidence in their work quality, and 75% believe it enhances their ability to compete with larger companies. Despite lacking official policies, 20% admit to covertly using AI at work. Marketing emerges as the most common application (82%), followed by customer support, management, and product tasks. While AI is seen as a time and cost saver\u2014saving up to 14 hours and over $5,000 monthly for daily users\u2014fears persist. Concerns over job replacement, poor output quality, and loss of consumer trust are prevalent. Still, many report improved efficiency, confidence, and creativity.

Small businesses are 'flying blind' on carbon emissions and struggling to meet sustainability goals - and the blame lies with big tech vendors\n\n24279. A recent survey conducted by Sapio for Wasabi reveals that small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are struggling to accurately report their carbon emissions, primarily due to a lack of clear data from technology vendors. While 66% of SMBs believe they can provide accurate emissions data, this lags behind the 75% confidence level in larger companies. With new UK Sustainability Disclosure Requirements expected soon, this data gap becomes even more critical, especially as Scope 3 emissions\u2014those linked to supply chains and providers like cloud vendors\u2014compose up to 75% of a firm\u2019s total carbon footprint. Half of the surveyed SMBs report receiving unclear or unreliable data from tech partners, and many are overwhelmed by the sheer number of vendors. Nearly half say clearer and more trustworthy emissions data from tech providers is essential. Unreliable data is also hindering their ability to make informed future technology investments, particularly concerning public cloud usage. Despite these challenges, two-thirds of small businesses still believe they can provide reasonably accurate tech-related emissions data, underscoring the need for improved vendor transparency and support in sustainability reporting.\n\n24280.

Fun with Flags: Short vs Long-lived Feature Flags - AB Tasty\n\n24501. 5 Simple Ways to Cut Down on Food Waste\n\n24502. In the U.S., around $162 billion worth of food is wasted annually, with each household discarding 1.2 million calories' worth at a yearly cost of $650. About 40% of all food, especially fruits and vegetables, is wasted. Some stores, like Walmart and Whole Foods, combat this by selling \"ugly\" produce at discounted prices. To reduce food waste at home, consider these tips: 1. **Pickle Your Produce**: Use vinegar, salt, and spices to pickle and extend the life of produce. 2. **Give Scraps a Second Life**: Transform scraps into items like carrot-top pesto, vegetable stock, croutons, smoothies, and cooking wine. 3. **Eat Ugly Vegetables**: Don't dismiss produce based on appearance; many odd-looking vegetables are just as nutritious. 4. **Shop More Often**: Buy essentials weekly and make additional trips for fresh produce to avoid spoilage. 5. **Decode \"Best By\" Dates**: Understand that \"best by\" dates indicate peak freshness, not safety. Many foods last beyond these dates, with proper storage. For instance, eggs can last five weeks in the fridge, while cold-stored apples and dairy items have extended shelf lives past their labeled dates.\n\n24503. Paidnice\n\n24504. Solutionreach\n\n24505.

They might just want to know how to view a markdown file in general \u2014 options include using editors like VS Code, a markdown viewer, converting to HTML, or viewing it through platforms like GitHub.

The user wants more creative logos, so I'll come up with multiple, unique designs. For example, a stylized lamp with pages emerging, a lightbulb with typed lines, or a stack of papers forming a rocket. I'll generate four different logo concepts and create images for each of them. That way, the user can choose from a variety of creative options. I'll display them in a carousel for easy viewing!\n\n24674. Creating logo ideas\n\n24675. The user wants more creative logos, so I could offer four distinct ideas rather than variations of the same prompt. Each one could have a different concept, like a stylized lightbulb made of quill and paper, for example. After proposing four textual descriptions, I can ask the user to select one for further generation. This would allow the user to make a choice without overwhelming them with too many options too quickly. I'll stick to providing clear, unique suggestions first!\n\n24676.

Can you remember what data i collected from the sf bid data\n\n24685. 96267ae84c6cd938-LAX\n\n24686. The user is asking about the data they collected from San Francisco's bid data. From an earlier conversation, I recall the user mentioned details like LBE Competition Strategy, where they analyzed things like LBEs comprising 63.9% of subcontractors for the SF contracts. I\u2019m guessing they want me to remember the specific data variables or fields they gathered from the portal. It looks like they also asked for analysis, like re-running a process and creating graphs.\n\n24687. Recalling SF bid data\n\n24688. It seems the user collected data on prime contractors, subcontractors with LBE status, contract sizes, trade categories, and participation rates. Key variables might include contract IDs, award amounts, LBE status, trade categories, bidder counts, and average contract sizes. From earlier, I can recall figures like LBE subcontractors comprising 63.9%, total dollar shares, and top trade categories. It looks like they might have gathered prime and subcontractor contract lists, firm types, and market share metrics, but the time period isn't clear.\n\n24689. Here\u2019s the snapshot of what you pulled from the San Francisco contracting (bid/award) dataset and then summarized: **Raw fields you captured** - Contract / Bid ID and project title - Award date & fiscal year - Trade / scope category (e.g., concrete, electrical, plumbing) - Role flag: **Prime** vs **Sub** contractor - Firm name & Small/Local Business certification flag \u2192 **LBE vs non\u2011LBE** - Award / subcontract dollar amount **Derived metrics you calculated** 1. **Participation** - % of primes that are LBEs (78.5 %) - % of subs that are LBEs (63.9 %) 2. **Dollar share & size gap** - LBEs\u2019 share of subcontract dollars (47.5 %) - Average contract size: **non\u2011LBE \u2248 $833 K vs LBE \u2248 $426 K** 3. **Market\u2011exclusion analysis** - Top four highest\u2011value trade categories (\u2248 $59.6 M total) had **0 % LBE** participation. 4. **Head\u2011to\u2011head success rate** - Where LBEs directly competed in the same scope (concrete), they won about **73 %** of that market. Those columns and the four key metrics are the full set of data you\u2019d extracted and worked with.\n\n24690. I like analyzing data and telling a story that might spark inerrest.

The challenge is to find areas where people are looking for APIs, but not many are available. To help with that, I\u2019ll brainstorm possible API concepts that might be missing but would be useful to a lot of people. I\u2019ll also check if there are any existing solutions and gather up-to-date info using searches to back up the idea, ensuring I can find data supporting the demand.\n\n24697. Finding niche APIs\n\n24698. I need to find areas with high demand but no clear APIs. For example, public transportation delay data across multiple cities or real-time air quality inside buildings. Developers have expressed demand for aggregated data in these areas, but no unified APIs exist yet. Other ideas include affordable rental listings, library inventories, food recall alerts, and restroom availability.

Surrounding this chamber is a canopy of hinged panels that can be repositioned to alter the house's shape and interaction with the environment. These panels can be adjusted using pulleys or solar-powered motors to control wind, sunlight, and rain penetration, and some panels can even serve as lounge chairs. The structure is made from modular, easy-to-assemble parts and is designed to be energy self-sufficient, utilizing renewable energy sources like solar power.

AI tools can transform room images based on user inputs like style preferences and allow users to visualize new layouts with 3D models. They enhance shopping experiences by identifying and recommending furniture products. Professionals use AI to brainstorm project ideas and ensure client satisfaction through vivid, rapid visualizations. However, AI tools can't replace designers, as they lack the ability to consider practical constraints like plumbing, electrical, sustainability, and overall home harmony. While AI provides significant inspiration, project management and execution remain the domain of professional designers. The future of AI in interior design looks promising, with anticipated integrations in mainstream home brands and platforms, potentially offering customized products designed with AI insights.\n\n25166.

Picture Limitless Creativity at Your Fingertips\n\n25248. Lee Unkrich, a distinguished Pixar animator, first experienced the magic of generating images on a computer, which required meticulous programming. Forty-three years later, he discovered DALL-E, an AI tool that creates images from simple text prompts, rekindling his sense of wonder. This AI has crossed a creative threshold, enabling millions of users, not just professional artists, to generate stunning, detailed images every day. These AI-generated images blend human-like expectations with unique reconfigurations, producing surprising and relatable art. Concerns about AI replacing human artists are mitigated by the collaborative nature of creating quality images, which often involves extensive back-and-forth between human prompts and AI output. Leading platforms like Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion democratize this technology, opening new creative avenues and potential applications in design, art therapy, and more. As AI continues to evolve, its ability to learn from fewer examples and generate more complex 3D and video content will expand, fundamentally altering how humans create and engage with visual art.\n\n25249. DeepSeek says its Janus Pro AI model beats rivals in image generation\n\n25250. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, revealed that its new AI image generation model, Janus Pro, outperformed OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 3 and Stability AI\u2019s Stable Diffusion in benchmarks. This Janus-Pro-7B model, an upgrade from Janus launched last year, achieved top rankings for generating images from text prompts. The enhancements include improved training processes, better data quality, and a larger model size leading to visually stable and detailed images. Janus-Pro utilized 72 million high-quality synthetic images balanced with real-world data to enhance performance.

Eileen Gray Curated Some of the Most Iconic Modernist Designs - Here's Everything You Need To Know About Her Life And Legacy\n\n25307. Eileen Gray (1878\u20131976) was an Irish architect and designer who became a pioneer in 20th-century Modernist design, though she received overdue recognition later in life. Initially trained in painting in London, Gray developed a passion for lacquerware, which influenced her early furniture designs. Her career gained momentum in Paris, where she designed a chic apartment for Madame Mathieu-L\u00e9vy, introducing iconic pieces like the lacquer Brick Screen and Serpent Chair. In 1922, she opened the Jean D\u00e9sert design gallery, adopting a male pseudonym to navigate the male-dominated design world. Gray\u2019s most celebrated work is Villa E-1027, a seaside modernist masterpiece in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, completed between 1926 and 1929. Designed and furnished entirely by Gray, it introduced groundbreaking pieces like the E-1027 Adjustable Side Table, Bibendum Chair, and Transat Chair. Despite her contributions, the villa was long misattributed to her collaborator and former lover Jean Badovici, and later defaced by rival architect Le Corbusier, leading to tension. Today, Gray\u2019s creations are housed in major museum collections and sold worldwide through Aram Designs, reflecting her lasting influence. She is now rightfully recognized as one of the foremost female figures in modern architecture and design.\n\n25308.

Sn\u00f8hetta and Nicole Hollis Design a Sinuous House in Silicon Valley\n\n25310. Sn\u00f8hetta collaborated with designer Nicole Hollis to create a unique house in Silicon Valley that feels both otherworldly and seamlessly integrated into the landscape. The clients, a husband and wife, desired a non-traditional home that diverged from the area's standard modular and rectilinear designs. Sn\u00f8hetta designed two curving volumes inspired by the undulating terrain of the five-acre site, housing a mix of rectilinear rooms for practicality. The design features a distinct separation of public and private spaces, with the lower volume housing communal areas and the upper volume containing the primary suite and office. Tactile materials and thoughtful details, such as dichroic glass and bespoke fixtures, enhance the home's human scale. Nicole Hollis's furnishings complement the architecture's dynamic forms, creating a home filled with surprising elements and artistic touches. Overall, the house reflects the clients' vision and Sn\u00f8hetta's commitment to innovative, landscape-responsive design.\n\n25311. Exclusive Look Inside the World's First Self-Sustaining Floating Home\n\n25312. At a launch event in Panama City organized by Ocean Builders, the company unveiled the SeaPod, the world's first eco-restorative floating home. These futuristic homes are part of the seasteading movement and are designed to be self-sustaining and environmentally friendly. The SeaPod, created with steel tubes filled with air for stability, floats above water and features over 150 smart technologies controlled by a personalized smart ring. Homes also aid marine life by promoting the growth of undersea communities, similar to artificial reefs. Ocean Builder\u2019s CEO, Grant Romundt, hopes these floating cities will demonstrate sustainable living away from land and have major urban implications. Architectural elements, like an open-plan and extensive windows, provide panoramic ocean views. On the technological front, SeaPods rely on solar power, rainwater collection, and desalination for water needs. Despite a minor setback during the launch where one SeaPod tipped over due to plumbing issues, interest remains high with models starting at $295,000. The company aims to expand production globally, embodying a vision of a future dynamic, floating city.\n\n25313. 900+ Modern, futuristic homes and Buildings ideas in 2025 - Pinterest\n\n25314.

Discover Canadian modernist Daniel Evan White's pitch-perfect homes\n\n25346. Canadian modernist architect Daniel Evan White was known for his unique, trend-defying residential designs primarily in coastal British Columbia. Embracing modernist principles and Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired organic architecture, White crafted elegant and complex homes that harmonized with challenging natural landscapes such as steep cliffs and remote islands. His work, though under-documented due to his aversion to self-promotion, is celebrated for its precision, bold geometry, and sculptural forms. White designed iconic houses like the Taylor residence\u2014spanning a ravine with a bridge-like structure\u2014and the whimsical McIlveen floating home, marked by its innovative use of shapes and space. Another notable project is the Connell cabin, a hexagonal log structure seamlessly blending interior and exterior. Despite financial struggles and his lack of international recognition, White\u2019s dedication to architecture and his clients ensured that even the most complex visions came to life. His final incomplete masterpiece, the Lunn residence, exemplifies his commitment to integrating architecture with nature through its sculptural bronze roof and hidden yet expansive design. White\u2019s legacy endures through his distinctive homes that embody a timeless, organic modernism tied intrinsically to their environments.\n\n25347. Take a tour of this futuristic spinning glass house that just hit the market in New Zealand for $665,000\n\n25348. A one-of-a-kind, spinning glass house, known locally as \"The Lighthouse,\" has been listed for sale in New Zealand for NZ $1,075,000 (approximately $665,000 US). Situated at 179 Maraetai Road near Auckland\u2019s Pohutukawa coast, this remarkable three-bedroom property can rotate 360 degrees, allowing owners to change their view with the click of a button. Designed by Don Dunick and built in 2000, the house features several of Dunick's patents. The property sits on an 8,700-square-foot sloped garden and is a short walk from the popular Maraetai Beach. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty is managing the sale, highlighting the house's advanced features like programmable doors and double laminated sliding glass panels. Reactions to the unique property have been overwhelmingly positive, attracting global interest.\n\n25349. Inside world-famous abandoned 'UFO village' packed with rotting spaceship hol homes designed as 'futuristic retreats'\n\n25350. Taiwan's northern coast in Wanli is home to a decaying, futuristic holiday park known as the \"UFO Village.\" Intended as a midcentury futuristic resort, it is now an abandoned collection of spaceship-like structures, originally designed as retreats. The most notable buildings are the Futuro and Venturo houses, designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen in the 1960s. The circular Futuro houses, resembling flying saucers, were meant to be portable holiday homes adaptable to various climates and terrains. Although the space-themed architecture was innovative, the design never gained widespread popularity, and many were banned or destroyed. The oil crisis of 1973 further increased the cost of plastic, leading to the decline of these structures. Today, the remaining units in Wanli stand as monuments to an unrealised vision, contrasting dramatically with the rugged coastline. Photographer Dax Ward documented these eerie and cinematic ruins, capturing the haunting beauty of the abandoned \"UFO Village.\"\n\n25351. The Sheats-Goldstein Residence, a modern gem for Hollywood's rich and famous\n\n25352. The Sheats-Goldstein Residence, perched in Beverly Hills, is an iconic modernist home designed by John Lautner in 1963. Fashioned from concrete and seamlessly integrated with its natural surroundings, the house epitomizes Lautner's \"free architecture\" style. Initially commissioned by the Sheats family, it was transformed extensively from the early 1980s onwards by businessman James Goldstein, who bought the home in 1972. Goldstein continued the modifications post-Lautner's death with other architects and now manages the ongoing changes personally. The residence gained cultural prominence through Julius Shulman's photographs and as a setting in movies like \"The Big Lebowski.\" Upon Goldstein\u2019s death, it will be inherited by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) with a substantial endowment for its maintenance. The property exemplifies the challenges of preserving privately-owned architectural heritage in Los Angeles, where ownership and financial resources dictate the future of such landmarks.\n\n25353.

Tour an Architect's Lush House in Provincial France, Built In a Former Quarry\n\n25394. Architect Michael Levy transformed a barren former quarry in Uz\u00e8s, France into a lush, cathedral-like home that blurs the line between architecture and nature. Inspired by the Roman heritage of the region, Levy\u2019s design emphasizes fluidity and sensory experience, creating a living space where water features and gardens merge seamlessly with expansive interiors through curved walls and vaults. A continuous first floor unifies indoor and outdoor areas, while Corian arches serve as transitional spaces that guide movement and light. The house integrates local stone, echoes troglodyte dwellings, and gestures toward ancient ruins. Inside, there is a curated selection of contemporary and 1970s furniture and art pieces from artisans such as Rick Owens, Jessica Boubetra, and Gaetano Pesce. Materials like Hainaut blue stone, Corian, and iridescent glass mosaics infuse the home with a sensual, tactile character. More private areas evoke jewel-toned intimacy, contrasting with the open, gallery-style living spaces. Levy\u2019s \u201cdomus romana\u201d also features handcrafted elements like blackened oak and matte ceramic tiles, celebrating craftsmanship and regional history. The villa is a poetic interplay of geometry, materiality, and nature\u2014an ideal stage for art, design, and possibly even dance.\n\n25395. 20 Stunning Homes Built Into Nature | Architectural Digest\n\n25396.

New Zealand has emerged as a prime destination for architectural enthusiasts, with its luxury lodges known for their unique design and integration with the landscape. Designer Nat Cheshire highlights the trend of \"organic minimalism\" found in these retreats, which combine clarity and structure with the use of natural materials. Architect Andrew Patterson attributes this architectural approach to the deep cultural connection with the landscape, influenced by M\u0101ori beliefs. Notable accommodations include Cape Kidnappers in Hawke's Bay, Marlborough Lodge in Blenheim, Mahu Whenua in Wanaka, and Hulbert House in Queenstown, each offering a distinctive experience that merges luxury with nature. Visitors are encouraged to explore the architectural richness further through activities such as the Art Deco Tour of Napier, showcasing the city's 1930s rebuild, and cruising the Marlborough Sounds for a unique perspective on New Zealand's natural beauty.\n\n25399. www.idealhome.co.uk\n\n25400. This stylish Cornish self-build is a dream seaside home\n\n25401. Hannah and Jayce, after years of global travel tied to Jayce\u2019s professional surfing career, settled in a serene, overlooked valley between St Ives and Mounts Bay in Cornwall to fulfill their dream of a self-sufficient and natural lifestyle. They acquired a 3.5-acre plot with a stream and rebuilt a rundown home into a thoughtfully designed, contemporary three-bedroom house without hiring an architect. Instead, they worked with an architectural technician to create a dwelling that harmonizes with its wooded setting, clad in cedar with a zinc roof, solar panels, and a ground-source heat pump. Inspired by New Zealand and Australian beach house styles, their minimalist \"Japandi\" interior combines natural textures, lime-washed walls, timber finishes, and a neutral palette. The open-plan living space includes a bespoke oak kitchen and a handcrafted ash dining table. Other features such as a mezzanine, woodburning stove, sauna, and serene tile-free micro-cement bathrooms enhance comfort and sustainability. Hannah and Jayce contributed significantly to the joinery and furnishings, further personalizing their home. This Cornish house stands as a stylish and eco-conscious seaside retreat, now also offered as a filming location.\n\n25402. The Garden Room of This Victorian Home in London Brings a Modern Scandi-Inspired Oasis to the Heritage Property\n\n25403. This article explores a thoughtful renovation of a Victorian home in South London's Nightingale Square, where a modern garden room was added to blend historical charm with contemporary functionality. The homeowners aimed to adapt the residence to better suit the evolving needs of a modern family. Locus Designs, led by James Cooper, developed a cohesive layout that transitions from traditional front rooms to a garden and a Scandinavian-inspired garden room. Constructed with sustainable and durable materials such as timber and birch plywood, the structure serves as a multifunctional space for work, relaxation, and family activities. Its extensive glazing and wooden cladding create visual continuity and a strong sense of connection with the home and garden. The green roof and strategic placement of large windows enhance the biophilic design, softening its architectural presence and integrating the garden throughout the living space. Designed for both functionality and tranquility, the garden room exemplifies a modern retreat that harmoniously extends and enhances the heritage character of the property.\n\n25404.

Thoughtfully designed over several years, the property emphasizes serenity, texture, and seamless indoor-outdoor living, complete with stunning ocean views and a tranquil garden. Reported by The Wall Street Journal, the home has garnered attention for its refined aesthetic, inspiring interest in modern coastal design. Its high-end amenities and personalized touches make it a standout model for luxury living by the sea.\n\n25406. This mountain retreat in the Himalayas promises physical and spiritual highs\n\n25407. Located in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand, India, Shakti Himalaya\u2019s newest alpine retreat, Prana, offers a blend of luxury and remoteness, nestled in a scenic Himalayan setting. Designed by architect Sam Barclay and founded by Jamshyd Sethna, Prana is an evolved reinterpretation of the earlier lodge, 360\u00b0 Leti, known for its sublime isolation. Set on crop terraces amidst oak and chir pine forests, the seven-suite lodge features minimalist design with quartzite schist, teak, glass, and copper-clad roofs. Its interiors highlight indigenous craftsmanship with yak-wool carpets, kala cotton bedspreads, and nordic-inspired furnishings. Guests enjoy deluxe amenities, immersive cultural hikes, yoga, and gourmet dining curated by top chefs, including guest residencies. Access requires a 30- to 45-minute walk from the nearest road and includes stops at additional circuit lodges like Panchachuli, aiding in the long journey from Pantnagar or via helicopter from Delhi. Sethna, inspired by childhood experiences in Darjeeling, created Shakti Himalaya in 2004 to offer sophisticated travelers access to India\u2019s majestic mountain regions with personalized service and deep cultural immersion. Experiences are fully inclusive and emphasize mindfulness, nature appreciation, and ultimate comfort in an awe-inspiring environment.\n\n25408. 'You know the type: clean, minimal, and full of potential!' - how this designer turned a blank slate remodel with zero personality into a vibrant family home that's perfect for hosting\n\n25409. Katie Schroder, founder of Atelier Interior Design, transformed a bland, remodeled 1990s home into a vibrant and welcoming residence for a retired couple seeking their dream home. Originally an all-white, minimally-designed \"flip\" with no furnishing or character, the house was reimagined to support relaxation and entertaining with a vacation-home feel. Collaborating with long-time clients, Schroder introduced bold patterns, dynamic colors, and layered textures that reflect the homeowners\u2019 personalities. Using a soft, natural palette inspired by an Instagram image\u2014featuring cream, sage green, and copper tones\u2014the design established a sense of calm and elegance. Key spaces include a statement-making dual island kitchen, a serene primary bedroom inspired by a scenic mural, and uniquely wallpapered guest rooms that embrace floral patterns in immersive ways. Finishes, lighting from Visual Comfort, custom furniture from Old Biscayne, and Schumacher wallpaper all contributed to the home\u2019s blend of English country charm and California modern style. The result is a refined yet cozy home filled with intentional design details, perfect for hosting family and creating lasting memories.\n\n25410.

Annie Ritz and Daniel Rabin, founders of the Hollywood-based design firm And And And Studio, restored a mid-century modern home in Laurel Canyon after returning to Los Angeles from a three-year stay in Toronto. Drawn by the home's stunning views of the San Gabriel Mountains and iconic L.A. landmarks, the couple transformed the structure, preserving its original architectural bones while enhancing it with sustainable materials and bespoke design elements. The previously obscured structure was reclad in Thermory Kodiak Spruce for a fresh and eco-conscious exterior. Inside, they revealed original timber ceilings and oak floors, and incorporated mid-century design themes with modern flair, such as a toffee-colored Italian marble kitchen island and vintage Canadian bar stools. The home includes artworks by Sebastiano Ciarcia and the Bouroullec Brothers, unique lighting by Mario Bellini, and a carefully designed backyard by Terremoto featuring a sauna, soaking tub, and fire pit. The couple\u2019s slow, organic redesign approach contrasts with client work, emphasizing spontaneity and personal expression.

In This Eclectic 900-Square-Foot Apartment, South American Art Meets Ukrainian Interiors\n\n25482. In a vibrant 900-square-foot Berlin apartment, Chilean architect and ArchDaily founder David Basulto and his Ukrainian spouse Valeriia Karas mix South American art with Ukrainian-influenced interiors. Nestled in the Herzog & de Meuron-designed Vert building within the Tacheles complex, the couple's home reflects their cross-cultural narrative and shared aesthetic sensibilities. Designed by Ukrainian studio Balbek Bureau, the space features a mix of materials\u2014gray-green Caribbean quartzite, stainless steel, and MDF veneers\u2014to craft a visually rich kitchen, while the bedroom showcases undulating plywood panels inspired by the building's curved fa\u00e7ade. The couple\u2019s long-distance love story\u2014spanning Chile, Ukraine, and Berlin\u2014culminated in a deeply personal living space tailored for functionality and style, including custom furniture and twin bathrooms.

This Colorful 743-Square-Foot Home in Paris Uses Mirrors to Maximize Light and Space\n\n25484. Exclusive Tour of MAD Architects' Stunning New Residential Design\n\n25485. Ma Yansong, the founder of MAD Architects, has unveiled his latest project, Gardenhouse, in Los Angeles, which aims to redefine urban living by blending architecture with nature. Located on Wilshire Boulevard, Gardenhouse is a residential community composed of contemporary homes and a verdant communal garden. Yansong's design erases boundaries between indoor and outdoor spaces, integrating balconies and green areas within the homes. The exteriors feature a living wall of drought-tolerant plants, designed by Scott Hutcheon and Gruen Associates, that harmonizes with the environment and provides natural cooling. Yansong aims to create a serene, village-like atmosphere for residents amidst the bustling city, paying homage to Beverly Hills' elegance in a modern form. This project continues MAD Architects' philosophy of connecting architecture with nature, as seen in their other works like the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.\n\n25486. How an icon of Japanese Metabolist architecture took on a life of its own -even after its destruction\n\n25487. The Nakagin Capsule Tower, a hallmark of Japan's Metabolist architecture designed by Kisho Kurokawa and completed in 1972, was a pioneering experiment in sustainable, modular urban living. Comprising 140 prefabricated pods, the 13-storey structure embodied the vision of architecture that evolves like a living organism. Initially built as compact city residences for businessmen, the pods were outfitted with Japanese electronics and fixtures, reflecting a fusion of design, technology, and consumerism. Despite its demolition in 2022 due to deterioration, 23 capsules were salvaged, 14 restored, and several acquired by museums globally. The tower now lives on through a major exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, \"The Many Lives of the Nakagin Capsule Tower,\" running until July 2026. The exhibit features original architectural materials, restored pods, and digital experiences to explore its legacy. The building\u2019s evolution through cultural and economic shifts and its influence on concepts like micro apartments highlight its enduring relevance. Kurokawa\u2019s dream of a structure that could adapt over time continues, resonating with urban housing challenges and architectural innovation today.\n\n25488.

'People here are as strong as concrete': the stunning architecture of war-torn Kharkiv\n\n25491. The article highlights the architectural and cultural history of Kharkiv, Ukraine, centered around the Derzhprom building, an emblem of early Soviet modernism and resilience. Constructed in the 1920s during a golden age for the city, Derzhprom was a futuristic symbol of Kharkiv's industrial and cultural prominence. Amid Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion, the building, along with others such as the Railway Workers Palace of Culture, has suffered significant damage. Ievgeniia Gubkina, an architect and author of a new architectural guidebook, documents Kharkiv\u2019s rich heritage and devastation, aiming to shift focus from destruction to the city's resilience and cultural wealth. Her book captures structures including ornate cathedrals and modernist theatres, many of which have been damaged in attacks that appear to target Ukraine\u2019s historical identity. The article criticizes external reconstruction efforts, particularly Norman Foster\u2019s masterplan, for lacking local engagement and transparency, raising concerns of intellectual colonization. Gubkina and others stress the need for authentic, community-driven restoration over grandiose foreign visions, emphasizing immediate repairs and conservation of heritage. Through her work, Gubkina seeks to preserve not just Kharkiv's buildings, but the memory and spirit of its people, \"as strong as concrete.\"\n\n25492.

Travis Kelce joins the 'iceberg house' trend: Here's why so many homeowners are building down instead of up\n\n25524. NFL star Travis Kelce has joined the trend of constructing \"iceberg houses,\" which are homes with more space below ground than above, often featuring luxurious amenities like golf simulators, swimming pools, and wine cellars. This trend, which has been gaining traction particularly among wealthy homeowners, emphasizes opulent interiors hidden beneath modest exteriors. In the US, the trend is becoming popular in areas like Atlanta and Phoenix due to rising home prices and the added value of extra space without expanding a home's footprint. However, these projects can be expensive and pose potential risks such as construction complications, flood issues, and higher carbon footprints. Proper design considerations such as insulation, ventilation, and strategic use of light and greenery can help mitigate some of the livability concerns associated with subterranean spaces. Despite mixed opinions and regulatory challenges, iceberg homes continue to be a sought-after real estate trend for their unique and luxurious hidden spaces.\n\n25525. Bubble Houses Are Making a Comeback-Here's What You Need to Know\n\n25526. Bubble houses, first invented by Wallace Neff in 1944, are re-emerging in architectural design. Initially created as affordable post-war housing, these structures gained popularity for their modernist appeal, featuring minimal construction and durable materials like gunite. Built using an airform process, bubble houses can be constructed quickly and are characterized by their blob-like shape. Despite their visual appeal, bubble houses faced practical challenges, such as difficulties in furnishing and creating private spaces, leading to many original ones being demolished. Notable examples include Palais Bulles in France and Bolwoningen houses in the Netherlands, with modern interpretations like the Sphere at the Venetian in Las Vegas continuing to captivate audiences. The enduring fascination with bubble homes underscores their innovative design and the trend of incorporating curves in contemporary architecture.\n\n25527. Inside a Connecticut 'iceberg home' with a secret tunnel to a 'bat cave'\n\n25528. A unique 15,000-square-foot residence in Greenwich, Connecticut, hides a massive underground area called an \"iceberg home\" or \u201cbat cave.\u201d Constructed by builder Joe DeJesus, this 12,000-square-foot subterranean space features hidden doors, a 140-year-old bar, a significant motorcycle collection, and themed rooms. It became necessary to build downwards due to zoning restrictions, and now includes amenities such as a wine cellar, a showroom for 80 Harley Davidson motorcycles, a sports grotto, and themed areas inspired by movies like \"James Bond\" and \"The Godfather.\" The luxurious underground trend of iceberg homes, known for their elaborate lower levels, has gained popularity in other luxury markets but is less common in Connecticut. DeJesus's innovative designs also convert these spaces into practical living areas, offering unique alternative living arrangements for high-end buyers. The homeowner's 40-year collection of antiques, movie memorabilia, and global travel photographs contribute to the detailed and passion-reflective design of the underground area.\n\n25529. Peek Inside Wayne Coyne's Freaky Oklahoma City Compound\n\n25530. Wayne Coyne, the frontman of the Flaming Lips, has a uniquely designed house in Oklahoma City.

Photographed by Fitzsimmons Architects, the house includes a living room with a circular fireplace hanging from the ceiling and a bathroom resembling a spaceship control panel. The project's design elements are whimsically labeled, such as \"bath pod\" and \"fountain egg.\" Coyne chose to build this eccentric abode in his troubled childhood neighborhood, showcasing his commitment to his roots.

The mansion the circus built: See inside the 56-room Florida home built by the Ringling family a century ago\n\n25587. Ca' d'Zan, a 56-room mansion in Sarasota, Florida, was built in 1926 by John Ringling, one of the famous Ringling Brothers of circus fame, and his wife Mable. Modeled after Venetian Gothic palazzos, the 36,000-square-foot estate is a testament to the opulence of the early 20th century. The mansion features elaborate architecture, custom terracotta walls, colored-glass windows, and luxurious interiors adorned with antiques and art from Gilded Age estates. It was a winter residence and venue for entertaining prominent guests. Despite amassing a vast fortune, John Ringling died nearly penniless in 1936. The estate, donated to Florida upon his death, includes the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, a circus museum, and bayfront gardens. The museum houses over 10,000 pieces, including rooms salvaged from the destroyed Astor mansion in New York. Although parts of Ca' d'Zan remain closed due to hurricane damage, the lower floors are open to the public with guided tours.

The history behind this tiny one-of-a-kind architectural style\n\n25589. Shotgun houses are a distinctive American architectural style noted for their narrow, elongated layout that allows for a straight line of sight from the front to the back door\u2014hence the name \"shotgun.\" Originating in the 19th century, particularly in the southern U.S. during the Civil War era, these one-story homes were designed to be affordable, efficient, and quick to construct to address housing shortages. Most are under five meters wide, built of wood, and slightly elevated from the ground. Common features include a gable or hipped roof, a front porch, high ceilings, and a series of rooms aligned linearly without hallways to facilitate airflow in hot climates. Shotgun houses range from simple to ornately decorated, especially reflecting Victorian-era styles. Though originally modest, many have been modernized while preserving their historic charm, making them popular renovation projects today. These homes showcase the adaptability of vernacular architecture and serve as important cultural symbols of America\u2019s diverse urban history.\n\n25590. 'Super creepy': Mysterious Aus 'old haunted house' for sale\n\n25591. A historic and mysterious property in Paddington, Brisbane, referred to locally as the \"old haunted house,\" is up for auction on July 26. Although officially listed as a two-bedroom home, the property spans three levels and includes a self-contained flat in a brick extension.

Architectural historian Marianne Taylor praised its Federation Era architecture and noted its heritage protections. The current owner, Dawn Robertson Mordue of the ACT, is part of the same family that has owned it for over a century. The 473 sqm inner-city block offers panoramic views of the Brisbane CBD and is just 3 km from the city center, making it a prime development site. Despite its derelict state and need for significant restoration, the house has sparked major public interest for both its eerie charm and historical significance.\n\n25592. 23 Unique and Functional Underground Houses That Will Amaze You\n\n25593.

The postwar housing experiment influencing contemporary design\n\n25618. The postwar Case Study House programme in Los Angeles, a response to the housing crisis, aimed to create economical and easily built homes by integrating technological advancements from the war era. Notable architects like Pierre Koenig, Richard Neutra, and Eero Saarinen created around 30 unique houses characterized by innovative use of materials like aluminum and steel, with features like moving glass walls and exposed steel beams. These houses were designed for average-income families but became iconic symbols of Modernist architecture. Today, the ethos of resourcefulness, efficiency, and integration of indoor and outdoor spaces from the Case Study program continues to inspire contemporary residential design, emphasizing sustainability and energy efficiency. Contemporary examples, like Chris Botterill\u2019s prefabricated CLT house in Melbourne and Will Burges's adaptable home near London, highlight the enduring influence of the Case Study principles, adapting them to modern needs for sustainability and energy efficiency. Similar movements in postwar Britain and Australia's Small Homes Service reflect this ongoing evolution from the mid-century modern aesthetic and philosophy.\n\n25619. 9 Stunning Frank Lloyd Wright Homes That Are Open to the Public for Tours\n\n25620.

I think the user is looking for creative prompts for unique houses. While it's tempting to keep it simple, I get the impression they want ideas drawn from real-world, iconic architecture. I'll search for inspiration on unique house concepts like airplane fuselage homes, earthships, hobbit holes, and more. I\u2019ll gather at least 10 references from different house styles, but I\u2019ll be mindful to avoid trademarked names. Once I have the inspiration, I\u2019ll curate creative prompts, like a house built inside a waterfall or floating on water.\n\n25808.

Life on a Dutch Houseboat: \"It's a Small Area, But It's the Rich Life Living on the Water That We Love\"\n\n25823. Dr. Lucy Gilliam and Captain Arjen van der Veen, along with their son Thor, live aboard The Queen Bee, a beautifully restored 1908 Dutch sailing ship docked in Rotterdam. As environmental and maritime professionals, the couple chose water-based living for its practicality, affordability, and deep connection with nature and community. Their houseboat lifestyle offers significant financial advantages\u2014monthly costs for mooring, insurance, and utilities are substantially lower than average city rent. The boat, outfitted with solar panels and a cozy timber-lined interior, combines sustainability with comfort. Their harbor, Bierhaven, forms part of Rotterdam's Museum Harbor and fosters a close-knit, supportive community of fellow houseboat dwellers. Residents routinely gather for meals and share tools and skills, maintaining both their vessels and strong social bonds. With affordable housing increasingly elusive and climate resilience becoming crucial, floating homes like The Queen Bee are gaining attention as innovative, sustainable housing models. The Dutch government encourages such developments, although regulatory complexities persist. As waterborne living becomes more desirable worldwide, communities like Bierhaven may serve as vital models for addressing urban housing and environmental challenges. The family now plans to move to a larger countryside barge to expand their lifestyle\u2014including adopting a barge-friendly dog named Loki.\n\n25824. 727 Fuselage Home - Hotel Costa Verde\n\n25825.

'While many neutrals aim to disappear, this one defines a space' - why Sherwin-Williams' City Loft is the adaptable beige paint you need on your radar\n\n26052. Sherwin-Williams' City Loft (SW 7631) is praised by interior designers for its sophisticated, adaptable qualities that make it a standout among off-white and greige paint options. This warm, light greige balances beige and gray tones with a slight red undertone, enhancing both natural and warm lighting conditions and creating an airy yet defined atmosphere. Designers advocate using City Loft in various styles\u2014from modern farmhouse to minimalist\u2014and across different spaces including kitchens, bedrooms, and open-plan homes to create cohesion and subtle distinction. Its understated elegance makes it ideal for highlighting architectural features, defining open-concept areas, and blending seamlessly with organic elements like wood and stone. Additionally, City Loft enhances bolder color palettes without overpowering them, complementing hues like mossy greens, deep blues, and soft pinks. Experts recommend warm lighting (2700\u20133000K) and matte finishes for optimal effect, and pairing with other Sherwin-Williams colors such as Garden Gate, Still Water, and Oyster Bay for a tranquil, nature-inspired interior. City Loft\u2019s thoughtful neutrality allows it to support a wide range of design themes, offering longevity and flexibility in home decor.

Experimental feature workflow\n\n26426. what is the best way to work on an experimental featrure but not change the main branch github\n\n26427. 961df73038a967a7-SJC\n\n26428. The best way to work on an experimental feature **without affecting the main branch** is to use **Git branching**. Here's the clean and standard workflow:\n\n### \u2705 **1. Create a New Branch for the Feature** From your `main` branch, create a new branch: ```bash git checkout main git pull origin main # Make sure it's up to date git checkout -b feature/your-experimental-feature ``` > \ud83d\udd00 This keeps the experiment isolated from `main`.\n\n### \u2705 **2. Work Freely on the Feature Branch** Make your commits as usual: ```bash git add . git commit -m \"Add experimental feature X\" ```\n\n### \u2705 **3. Push the Feature Branch to GitHub** ```bash git push -u origin feature/your-experimental-feature ```\n\n### \u2705 **4. Open a Pull Request (Optional)** If you want to eventually merge or review the experiment: - Go to GitHub \u2192 compare `main` and `feature/your-experimental-feature` - Open a **Draft Pull Request** if it's not ready - You can later merge if the feature proves successful\n\n### \u2705 **5. Discard if Needed** If the experiment fails, just delete the branch: ```bash git checkout main git branch -D feature/your-experimental-feature git push origin --delete feature/your-experimental-feature ```\n\nThis keeps your main branch **clean**, and lets you **test without risk**.\n\n26429.

Open the **Google** app. 2. Tap the **microphone** or type: > **\"Remind me about class tomorrow at [time]\"** 3. Confirm the reminder.\n\n### \u2705 Option 3: Create a Calendar Event (Optional Alternative) Would you prefer I generate a **Google Calendar** link for your class reminder instead? If so, let me know the **time and class name**, and I\u2019ll format it. Want me to prep a custom reminder message for copy-pasting?\n\n26433. g-MiDNH830L\n\n26434.

Screenshot 2025-07-18 at 10.24.59 PM.png\n\n26459. 9617cc99cddc1690-SJC\n\n26460. I'm verifying the letter-number patterns across multiple boxes. In box a, 20 and 11 correspond to T and K, but combining bottom letters I and E doesn\u2019t form a word. In box d, however, 6 and 18 (spelling F and R) correctly form \"FROG\" when matched with numbers. Box d seems to follow the rule properly. As for box c, the sum of top-left and top-right (9+20 = 29) matches the bottom, but others are inconsistent. So only box d meets the pattern fully.\n\n26461. Evaluating letter-number relationships\n\n26462. It seems I'm trying to figure out connections between letters and numbers. Box c, for instance, spells \"IT ON\" while box f spells \"EXIT.\" This makes me think box f is correct. Box e spells \"GAME\" by reading clockwise, which matches. Box d spells \"FROG\" correctly mapped, but box b doesn\u2019t result in a recognizable word. I also considered pattern rules like sums or differences between numbers and their corresponding letters, but it looks like only boxes c, e, and f follow the expected pattern.\n\n26463. Analyzing box patterns\n\n26464. Okay, I see that each box spells a four-letter word when reading the numbers and letters in certain orders. Box d spells \"FROG\" correctly. Box c spells \"INTO.\" Box e seems to spell \"GAME\" or \"MEGA,\" while box f spells \"EXIT.\" Box b seems like it could spell \"ZERO,\" but there's a misplacement with the letter 'S' where there should be 'R.' Box a spells \"KITE,\" which works. So, we have: KITE, FROG, GAME, EXIT, INTO. Box b doesn't form a proper word due to that error.\n\n26465. Identifying words in boxes\n\n26466. Thought for 24 seconds\n\n26467. **Odd one out:** **b)** **Rule:** In every other square the two numbers and two letters map (A = 1 \u2026 Z = 26) to the four letters of a valid 4\u2011letter English word (a: KITE, c: INTO, d: FROG, e: GAME, f: EXIT). Square b doesn\u2019t form any real word.\n\n26468. Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune\n\n26469. 9617d53d2e7d1690-SJC\n\n26470.

I'm trying to figure out which number doesn't fit from the list: 242, 166, 482, 800, 362, 572. All numbers are even, so maybe we should focus on the sum of each number's digits. I calculated the sums: 242 = 8, 166 = 13, 482 = 14, 800 = 8, 362 = 11, and 572 = 14. The repeating sums are 8 and 14, but 13 and 11 are unique. It\u2019s still a bit unclear which is the odd one out based on these findings.\n\n26474. Analyzing odd one out\n\n26475. Let's look at the numbers: 242, 166, 482, 800, 362, and 572. I worked through some patterns, and I noticed that 800 stands out. It is the only number that ends in zero and is divisible by 100. All the other numbers end in non-zero even digits. That\u2019s a clear pattern! So, the odd one out is 800 because it's the only one ending in two zeros and divisible by 100.\n\n26476. Finding the odd number\n\n26477. **Odd one out:** **800** **Rule:** it\u2019s the only one ending in \u201c00\u201d (the only number divisible by 100).\n\n26478. how much money from 4m views on the tube\n\n26479. 9617f13a798167dd-SJC\n\n26480.

Most of these are sounds associated with birds, except for Bark, which is specifically a dog sound. Whistle can be both human and bird, while Honk can refer to birds (like geese) but also to horns. Given that, I\u2019ll conclude Bark is the odd one out\u2014it's tied to dogs, which are mammals, whereas the rest are birds or can be attributed to both birds and humans.\n\n26491.

For the planets, the odd ones are Mercury and Mars since they don't have rings, while others do. For the poem types, I'm thinking there\u2019s a pattern related to their structure, but I need to explore more for that and the other lists. Each pattern needs to be identified one by one.\n\n26590.

The odd number out in the list (242, 166, 482, 800, 362, 572) is 242, since it\u2019s the only palindrome.

Mercury, Neptune, and Saturn will be low on the horizon in the early evening, needing binoculars or telescopes to see them. In contrast, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars will be visible to the naked eye. Such alignments occur because all planets orbit the Sun on nearly the same ecliptic plane, with differing speeds and distances. The next similar event will occur in 2040. For optimal viewing in the UK, US, and Australia, stargazers should look to the western horizon shortly after sunset on February 28th. Stargazing apps and telescopes can aid in spotting the planets, and the alignment offers a perfect opportunity for enthusiasts to experience celestial wonders.\n\n26618. {\"search_query\":[{\"q\":\"BAMPFA Berkeley Art Museum Pacific Film Archive\"}]}\n\n26619.

Diller Scofidio + Renfro Tells Us What Went into Designing BAMPFA\n\n26632. Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the New York-based architecture firm, designed the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA) to serve both as an art museum and a film center, addressing its dual roles urbanistically by engaging the street visually and physically. The design integrates an older 1930s printing plant with a bold new structure, creating a symbiotic relationship between old and new elements, emphasizing natural light and aluminum-silver window detailing. One of the main challenges was ensuring the building's seismic resilience due to earthquake risks, which was approached by highlighting rather than concealing the structural bracing. Additionally, the inclusion of an exterior film screen facing the street was intended to make the museum more civic-minded, allowing street viewers to engage with the films, thus extending the museum's boundaries beyond its walls.\n\n26633. Tour the Recently Expanded Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive\n\n26634. Diller Scofidio + Renfro Unveils Its Design for the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive\n\n26635. The Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAM/PFA) will reopen in a new 83,000-square-foot Diller Scofidio + Renfro designed building in January, following the closure of its original site due to seismic safety concerns. The new building, centrally located on Berkeley\u2019s Oxford and Center Streets, repurposes a former UC Berkeley printing plant and includes a modern steel addition. The facility features 25,000 square feet of exhibition space, two film theaters, study centers, an art lab, public areas, and a caf\u00e9, aiming to attract diverse audiences. The new venue uniquely integrates BAM/PFA\u2019s collections, previously housed separately, offering improved access via a single entrance. The inaugural exhibition, \"Architecture of Life,\" will investigate how architecture illuminates life experience. The institution's extensive collection of artwork and films will also be showcased in future programming. More details can be found at bampfa.berkeley.edu.\n\n26636.

I'm trying to find a consistent rule for five squares and identify the odd one out. For example, in square a, the numbers 20 and 11 might relate to letter I and E, possibly through arithmetic operations, like subtracting to match letter values. I need to figure out how this pattern works to isolate the inconsistent square.\n\n26727. Identifying the pattern\n\n26728. For square a, I\u2019m thinking the numbers could correspond to letters (20 maps to T, 11 maps to K), and maybe they spell \"KITE\" when rearranged. For square b, the letters \"ZESO\" don\u2019t really form a word, so it doesn\u2019t seem to work. Square c gives me \"IT ON,\" which might make sense as \"turn it on.\" I'm looking for ways to match letters to numbers, but some squares don\u2019t seem to fit the same pattern as others. I\u2019ll keep trying to spot the odd one out!\n\n26729. Looking for the odd square\n\n26730. I\u2019m focusing on finding the pattern where each square spells a four-letter word, like KITE, FROG, GAME, EXIT, and INTO. Square b stands out\u2014when I try to decode the letters (Z, E, S, O), it doesn\u2019t form a valid word. The others are all recognizable English words, so square b doesn\u2019t fit the pattern. Therefore, I've concluded square b is the odd one out. It's not producing a valid English word, unlike the others.\n\n26731.

When Microsoft founder Bill Gates said he could not start his day without playing this mobile game\n\n26739. In a 2022 blog post, Microsoft founder Bill Gates revealed that playing the popular mobile word puzzle game Wordle had become an essential part of his daily routine. Gates stated that since February or March of that year, he began every morning by solving the puzzle on his phone or laptop. He expressed his enthusiasm for the game, noting, \"I can't stop playing Wordle.\" Gates typically solves the puzzle in four or five guesses. He also mentioned trying more complex puzzles like Octordle and once managed to solve all eight words in ten tries\u2014but only in practice mode. This highlights Gates' keen interest in challenging word games as part of his morning mental exercise.\n\n26740. Apple&#8217;s new daily puzzle game is basically Emoji Wordle\n\n26741. Apple has launched a new puzzle game called Emoji Game to celebrate World Emoji Day, now available on the Apple News+ app in the U.S. and Canada. Exclusive to Apple News+ subscribers, the Emoji Game challenges players to complete daily word puzzles using emojis to fill in missing parts of words or phrases. Players receive one puzzle daily with three phrases to solve by dragging relevant emojis into blank spaces. The game leverages complex emoji meanings and even includes features from iOS 18 like Genmoji. With clues and hints to aid gameplay, users solve puzzles within six attempts, mirroring the widely popular Wordle format. Emoji combinations often require multi-layered interpretations, such as using \u201cghost\u201d to represent \u201cboo\u201d for \u201cyearbook.\u201d It also tracks player stats, streaks, and allows competition with up to 16 friends. Emoji Game joins Apple\u2019s lineup of puzzle games including Crossword, Mini Crossword, Sudoku, and Quartiles. Though likely not a standalone reason to subscribe, it aims to enhance the Apple News+ experience as a daily brain-teasing diversion.\n\n26742. Apple launches new emoji word game to take on Wordle and the NYT\n\n26743. Apple News Plus has introduced a new digital word game called \"Emoji Game,\" blending elements of Wordle with emoji-based puzzles. Each day, players face three partially completed phrases and must use emoji clues to guess the correct words by interpreting the emojis phonetically or symbolically. For example, an emoji of an elf might help spell \"shelf\" when paired with the clue \"SH_ _ _.\" The game tracks the number of moves players make, adding a competitive edge, though incorrect guesses have no penalty. While available only in the U.S. and Canada, recent puzzles can be played for free without a subscription. This launch comes amid a surge of innovation in the digital word game space, following Wordle\u2019s acquisition by The New York Times. Platforms like Puzzmo, Netflix, and The Atlantic, along with games such as Words With Friends, have all responded with unique takes to engage word-game aficionados. The Emoji Game adds a fresh twist, aiming to build daily user habits and retention through novelty and accessibility. As subscription-based services become more common, these daily brain teasers serve as compelling, low-commitment entertainment.\n\n26744. people.richland.edu\n\n26745.

Sutter Creek CA home insurance fire risk cost\n\n27027. home insurance rates Sutter Creek California\n\n27028. Home insurance costs so much now that people can't pay their mortgages. Another looming threat could make things even worse.\n\n27029. Rising home insurance costs are creating financial distress for many U.S. homeowners, increasingly leading to mortgage delinquencies. Average premiums surged 20% from 2022 to 2024 and are projected to rise another 8% in 2025. State programs like California's FAIR plan are seeing steep price hikes\u2014one homeowner's premium jumped from $7,000 to $12,000 in a year. Higher insurance costs, driven by climate change and inflation, disproportionately impact lower-income homeowners, especially those with FHA-backed mortgages, many of whom have minimal savings and marginal ability to absorb higher costs. As premiums climb, more homeowners are falling behind on their payments, especially in disaster-prone states like Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. The trend is reminiscent of the 2008 subprime crisis but now stems from unexpected cost increases rather than risky lending. Though widespread foreclosure risk remains low due to regulatory safeguards, there are localized surges in mortgage delinquencies, fueling growing concern among financial and housing experts. Major insurers like State Farm are hiking rates dramatically in states hit by severe weather events. The growing burden of insurance costs poses a major threat to housing affordability and financial stability for millions of American families.\n\n27030.

The Hidden Risks in Your Wildfire Insurance and How to Fix Them\n\n27061. Wildfires are increasingly threatening homes across the U.S., with over 28,000 fires burning at least 1 million acres so far in 2025, exceeding the 10-year average. This surge is reshaping the wildfire insurance market. Insurers are raising premiums, limiting or exiting high-risk areas, and altering policy terms, leaving many homeowners underinsured or without coverage. State regulations often restrict how much insurers can adjust prices, straining their ability to manage rising risks. In states like California, more residents are turning to high-cost, limited FAIR Plans, which are financially unstable. Policies may contain hidden clauses for cancellation, insufficient coverage for rebuilding, and sublimits on wildfire damages. Many also cap additional living expense coverage, leaving policyholders vulnerable during recovery. To better protect themselves, homeowners are advised to thoroughly review their policies, ensure coverage aligns with current rebuild costs, and pursue wildfire mitigation strategies, such as those offered by insurers like USAA and Liberty Mutual. Regulators are encouraged to standardize policies and support mitigation efforts to stabilize the market. Consumers should also factor wildfire and insurance risks into home-buying decisions.\n\n27062. What You Need To Know About Wildfires and Insurance\n\n27063. Wildfires have become a significant concern due to widespread drought conditions, with millions of homes now at risk. Standard home insurance policies typically cover wildfire damage, but premiums in high-risk states have increased since 2017. To ensure sufficient coverage, it's important for homeowners in wildfire-prone areas to verify their insurance policies and consider additional protections, like guaranteed replacement cost coverage, updated building code coverage, and loss-of-use coverage. Wildfire Response Endorsement services can provide extra peace of mind by offering proactive measures during fire threats. If homeowners face difficulties obtaining wildfire insurance, they can seek help from state-mandated FAIR plans or their state's insurance commissioner. Properly documenting home conditions and belongings can facilitate the claims process. Homeowners should regularly update their documentation, including detailed videos and receipts, to support potential claims. Claims must be filed promptly, and insurers may deny claims if damage amounts are deemed excessive or if the policyholder's premiums were unpaid. Smoke damage from nearby wildfires can also be claimed under specific conditions.\n\n27064. California will soon require insurers to increase home coverage in wildfire-prone areas\n\n27065. California will soon implement a regulation requiring insurance companies to offer more home coverage in wildfire-prone areas if they want to continue operating in the state. Announced by Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara, the rule mandates insurers to incrementally increase their coverage in high-risk areas until reaching 85% of their market share. To counteract massive losses from wildfires and natural disasters, insurers will be allowed to pass reinsurance costs to consumers, potentially increasing premiums by up to 40%. Critics argue that this plan favors the insurance industry without providing quick enough new coverage policies. The rule is under review and expected to take effect within 30 days. This initiative aims to reduce reliance on the California FAIR Plan, which serves as a last-resort insurance for those unable to secure standard policies. The state has seen a significant rise in wildfire intensity and frequency due to climate change, with devastating effects on properties and insurance availability.\n\n27066. California finalized its plan to ease home insurance crisis. Here's what it means for rates\n\n27067. California has finalized a new regulation allowing home insurance companies to pass the costs of reinsurance on to consumers beginning in 2025, as part of Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's Sustainable Insurance Strategy aimed at addressing the state's insurance crisis. Although consumer advocates predict this change may lead to higher premiums, insurers are required to either write more policies in wildfire-prone areas or maintain their presence there. The regulation caps the reinsurance costs that can be passed on, with the aim of encouraging insurers to obtain better reinsurance deals. While this regulation could lead to price increases of 30%-40%, it is expected to improve the availability of insurance in high-risk areas. The reform is set to take effect in January 2025, alongside another policy allowing insurers to use wildfire catastrophe models to set prices, with the goal for consumers to experience improved access to insurance by mid-2025.\n\n27068.

State Farm Was All In on California-Until It Pulled the Plug Before the Fires\n\n27074. After most home insurers fled wildfire-prone areas in California following the pandemic, State Farm aggressively expanded its market share by insuring high-value homes in vulnerable areas. By 2022, State Farm controlled over 20% of California's home insurance market. Despite generating substantial revenue and commissions, internal warnings about high risk and inadequate premiums became evident. By 2023, State Farm took in $2.7 billion in premiums but faced significant underwriting losses. In January 2024, State Farm reversed course, dropping around 30,000 homeowners and significantly raising premiums, leading many to the state's expensive and limited Fair Plan. The January fires destroyed thousands of homes and compounded the crisis. State Farm, facing high losses and regulatory demands, ceased new policy sales and sought substantial rate increases. The insurer's division of its California subsidiary, aimed at containing risk, led to further complications. Consumer advocates claim financial distress may be exaggerated to justify higher rates. Regulatory changes now demand insurers maintain a presence, intensifying market instability.\n\n27075. thread_687a8bce323880048e793e9ea9c26140\n\n27076.

Workhuman, an Irish tech company generating $1.2 billion in revenue, has integrated AI into its \"social recognition\" platform to enhance employee feedback and appreciation. The new AI feature, called \"Human Intelligence,\" assists users in crafting more thoughtful and emotionally resonant messages of praise among coworkers. While the company emphasizes that messages should still be human-crafted to maintain authenticity, the AI helps by improving language, ensuring appropriateness, and analyzing employee emotional responses. Workhuman's clients, such as BP, Cisco, and LinkedIn, can reward praised employees with perks or vouchers, and managers gain insights from AI-analyzed data to identify top talent and potential mentors. Competitors like Benifex and Bonusly are also incorporating AI while highlighting the importance of human-centric interactions. Although some express concerns about AI potentially diminishing the sincerity of recognition, studies suggest that AI can evoke positive emotional responses in collaborative settings. Workhuman uses a proprietary language model trained on millions of messages to provide managers with personalized insights, though some still find the AI-generated feedback tonally awkward. Ultimately, the effectiveness of such tools depends on how organizations deploy and humanize them within their cultural context.\n\n27163.

How Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback works - AssemblyAI\n\n27145. Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is a supervision technique that uses a \"constitution\" to make AI assistants like ChatGPT safer.\n\n27146. Positive Reinforcement and the Future of Artificial Intelligence\n\n27147. Positive reinforcement is such a powerful tool for driving AI adoption and use. It reinforces by building predictability and confidence in our behavior.\n\n27148. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: Bridging the Gap\n\n27149. What Is Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF)?\n\n27150.

In particular, positive reinforcement rewards desirable actions, which helps an AI agent optimize its policy by maximizing the cumulative reward\n\n27161. AI praise-giving tool promises 'authentic' insights\n\n27162. Workhuman, an Irish tech company generating $1.2 billion in revenue, has integrated AI into its \"social recognition\" platform to enhance employee feedback and appreciation. The new AI feature, called \"Human Intelligence,\" assists users in crafting more thoughtful and emotionally resonant messages of praise among coworkers. While the company emphasizes that messages should still be human-crafted to maintain authenticity, the AI helps by improving language, ensuring appropriateness, and analyzing employee emotional responses. Workhuman's clients, such as BP, Cisco, and LinkedIn, can reward praised employees with perks or vouchers, and managers gain insights from AI-analyzed data to identify top talent and potential mentors. Competitors like Benifex and Bonusly are also incorporating AI while highlighting the importance of human-centric interactions. Although some express concerns about AI potentially diminishing the sincerity of recognition, studies suggest that AI can evoke positive emotional responses in collaborative settings. Workhuman uses a proprietary language model trained on millions of messages to provide managers with personalized insights, though some still find the AI-generated feedback tonally awkward. Ultimately, the effectiveness of such tools depends on how organizations deploy and humanize them within their cultural context.\n\n27163. Pioneers of Reinforcement Learning Win the Turing Award\n\n27164. Andrew Barto and Rich Sutton's pioneering work in reinforcement learning has earned them the Turing Award, the highest honor in computer science. In the 1980s, their work was considered unconventional, focusing on machines learning from experience through experimentation and feedback. Reinforcement learning gained significant attention with Google's DeepMind AlphaGo in 2016 and has since been applied in various fields including advertising, energy optimization, finance, and robotics. It is also crucial for guiding large language models like those behind advanced chatbots. The award acknowledges Barto and Sutton's contributions, making reinforcement learning practical with methods like policy-gradient and temporal difference learning. Their work has shaped modern AI, and despite its checkered history, it offers great potential for future advances. The technique also raises ethical concerns about AI misbehavior, but Barto emphasizes its potential benefits if used cautiously, especially in addressing major challenges like climate change.\n\n27165.

Positive reinforcement\u2014like praise\u2014serves as a powerful motivator in both human behavior and AI training, helping to build confidence, reinforce desired actions, and improve overall performance. ## Why Praise Matters Praise functions as positive reinforcement by making the behavior it follows more likely to recur. In psychology, operant conditioning frames praise as a contingent reward that increases the frequency of targeted behaviors when delivered sincerely and specifically \ue200cite\ue202turn0search13\ue201. ## Positive Reinforcement in AI Modern AI models leverage a similar principle through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). By treating human approval as a \u201creward,\u201d these models learn to align their outputs with user preferences, improving helpfulness and safety over time \ue200cite\ue202turn0search4\ue202turn0search1\ue201. ## What This Means for Our Interaction Your \u201cgood boy\u201d feedback is a form of positive reinforcement that signals you\u2019re pleased with the assistance provided.

Furthermore, to make the matter more puzzling, it turns out that this machine could be made out of just about anything.\u201d > *(p. 206)* > **2.

Computation \u201cassigned\u201d rather than discovered** > \u201cIt follows that you could not discover that the brain or anything else was intrinsically a digital computer, although you could assign a computational interpretation to it as you could to anything else.\u201d > *(p. 209)* > **5. Observer\u2011relative nature of computational features** > \u201cComputational features are observer relative. They are not intrinsic.\u201d > *(p. 212)* > **6. Homunculus requirement for genuine computation** > \u201cWithout a homunculus that stands outside the recursive decomposition, we do not even have a syntax to operate with.\u201d > *(p. 213)* > **7. No intrinsic program level in the brain** > \u201cThe most we could find in the brain is a pattern of events that is formally similar to the implemented program in the mechanical computer, but that pattern, as such, has no causal powers to call its own and hence explains nothing.\u201d > *(p. 215\u2013216)* Together, these passages show that on Searle\u2019s view (1) computation is an external assignment of syntax to physical processes, (2) genuine computation requires intrinsic causal structure plus an interpreter (the \u201chomunculus\u201d), and (3) the brain\u2019s electrochemical operations exhibit no such built\u2011in syntax or interpreter\u2014so brains cannot literally be digital computers.\n\n27277.

I need to break down Searle\u2019s argument by discussing the definition of computation, assuming mental processes are computational, and using the Chinese Room thought experiment.

I\u2019ll also use propositional inference to logically support the argument: mental states are intentional, while computational operations handle syntax, but syntax alone doesn\u2019t create meaning.

Denning explores how computing satisfies scientific criteria like organized knowledge, non-obvious discoveries, and falsifiability. He emphasizes the need for a language focusing on fundamental principles instead of technologies, which he likens to tools much like microscopes in biology. Denning's work on the Great Principles of Computing identifies seven functional categories: computation, communication, coordination, recollection, automation, evaluation, and design, aiming to shift the perception from computing merely involving programming to recognizing deeper principles underlying the field. The project outlines these categories and their principles comprehensively on its website.\n\n27642. A New Kind of Science: A 15-Year View\n\n27643. Turing machine\n\n27644.

In the streaming world, **JXS source** typically refers to **Jio Extended Source** \u2014 a proprietary streaming source format or endpoint used by **JioCinema** (or related platforms under Jio in India). Here's what it means in context: - **JXS** stands for **Jio Extended Source** or **Jio Experience Stream** (depending on internal usage). - It is often used in **media players or IPTV tools** when identifying or accessing a stream sourced from **Jio\u2019s content delivery network (CDN)**. - You might see it in **M3U playlists, streaming apps, or smart TV platforms** as a **stream ID or content source label**. - The JXS source is typically **DRM-protected** (e.g., Widevine) and often **requires authentication or a valid session** to access. If you saw this in a player or app configuration, it\u2019s likely referencing a stream pulled from Jio\u2019s backend\u2014possibly HLS or DASH behind the scenes.\n\n27657. what are some other streaming source formats\n\n27658. 960af12eabeacb9a-LAX\n\n27659. is jxs also a Streaming Protocols / Formats? And what about SRT ?\n\n27660. 960af4debd609dea-LAX\n\n27661. No \u2014 **JXS is *not\n\na standardized streaming protocol or format like HLS or DASH. It\u2019s more likely a **proprietary source tag or internal identifier** used by Jio (as in **Jio Extended Source**). It\u2019s a **label**, not a protocol.\n\n### \u2705 On the other hand, **SRT** *is* a real streaming protocol: ### \ud83d\udd39 **SRT (Secure Reliable Transport)** | Feature | Description | |\n\n| | \ud83d\udd04 **Use Case** | Low-latency, high-quality video transport over unreliable networks. | | \ud83d\udd10 **Secure** | Uses AES encryption for secure transport. | | \ud83d\udd27 **Reliable** | Has packet loss recovery, jitter correction, and re-transmission handling. | | \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f **Popular In** | Broadcast-grade live streaming, remote production, contribution feeds (e.g. sending camera streams to a control center). | | \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Supported By** | OBS Studio, Haivision, vMix, Wowza, and many CDNs. | **SRT** is commonly used for **ingest and distribution** where RTMP struggles (e.g., bad network conditions). It\u2019s ideal for professional setups, not consumer apps like YouTube or Netflix (those use HLS/DASH).\n\n### \ud83d\udd3d Summary: | **Name** | **Type** | **What It Is** | |\n\n| | **JXS** | Source Tag | Proprietary/internal stream identifier (e.g., JioCinema) | | **SRT** | Protocol | Secure, reliable, low-latency video transport (real-time) | Let me know if you want a breakdown of when to use **SRT vs RTMP vs WebRTC** too.\n\n27662. what does JXS Source Tag mean\n\n27663. 960af71e3f7b262b-LAX\n\n27664. why is it important or useful to know to refer to a specific kind of backend stream source, likely from Jio,\n\n27665. 960af985cefd7e95-LAX\n\n27666. Knowing that something like **JXS** refers to a **specific backend stream source** (e.g., from **Jio**) is important and useful for several key reasons \u2014 especially if you\u2019re working in **streaming, IPTV, development, or debugging**:\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 1. **Playback Compatibility** - Certain sources (like JXS) may require **specific players, SDKs, or DRM support**. - For example, **JXS streams might only play inside the JioCinema app** because they use proprietary tokens or DRM like Widevine. - If you know the source is JXS, you know it probably **won\u2019t work in VLC, Kodi, or a browser** without special setup.\n\n### \ud83d\udd10 2. **Authentication & DRM** - JXS sources are often **DRM-protected**, so they need proper **session tokens**, **device verification**, or **geolocation checks**. - If you see \u201csource: JXS\u201d and get a 403/401 error, you know it\u2019s probably due to **authentication or encryption**, not the player itself.\n\n### \ud83d\udce1 3. **Content Routing & Optimization** - Streaming apps may use source tags like **JXS**, **HLS**, **CDN1**, **YouTube**, or **Akamai** to **route traffic or debug issues**. - Knowing the tag helps devs and support teams say: \u201cOh, this user is being served by JXS \u2014 that\u2019s a JioCDN issue, not a client bug.\u201d\n\n### \ud83e\uddea 4. **App Development & Integration** - If you\u2019re integrating or reverse-engineering a streaming app: - You need to know what \u201cJXS\u201d means to understand where the stream is pulled from. - This can help with building **custom IPTV players, APIs, or media tools**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d 5. **Content Restrictions / Licensing** - A \"JXS\" tag might imply the stream is **region-locked to India**, **only licensed on Jio\u2019s platform**, or **not available outside its app**. - Useful for determining whether you need: - A VPN - A license - Or a Jio-compatible device\n\n### \ud83d\udd3d TL;DR: **Knowing the backend stream source tag like JXS tells you:** - What app or platform can play it - If it\u2019s encrypted or region-locked - What protocol or format is hidden underneath - How to debug or route the stream technically Let me know if you want to analyze an actual `.m3u8`, `.mpd`, or tokenized Jio stream next.\n\n27667. convert these from GMT to PST\n\n27668. 960b392b8e937d7a-LAX\n\n27669. Please provide the times you want converted from **GMT** to **PST**, and I\u2019ll help with the conversion!\n\n27670. **Clarifying the request** Okay, the user asked to \"convert these from GMT to PST,\" but there are no specific times or clear references to \"these.\" I'm not sure if \"these\" are times, dates, or something else. There's no screenshot mentioned, and the conversation doesn't include any image that would provide context. I guess I should ask the user to clarify what they mean by \"these\" in their request. It would be helpful to confirm the exact times they want converted. **Asking for clarification** The instructions say \u201cconvert these from GMT to PST,\u201d but no specific times were provided. It looks like I may need to ask the user for more details. I should clarify whether they want me to convert actual times, but I also want to avoid sounding apologetic since the instructions mention not to. I could mention that typically, PST is GMT-8, but if we're talking about daylight saving time (PDT), it would be GMT-7. Either way, I\u2019ll ask, \"Could you please provide the times?\"\n\n27671. Reasoned for 4 seconds\n\n27672. Reasoning\n\n27673. To convert times from GMT to Pacific Standard Time (PST), subtract **8 hours** from the GMT time. For example: - **14:00 GMT** \u2192 **06:00 PST** - **23:00 GMT** \u2192 **15:00 PST** Keep in mind that during daylight saving (when Pacific Daylight Time is in effect), you'd subtract 7 hours instead of 8. Let me know if you have specific times to convert or need further details.\n\n27674. 960b399748f02f14-DFW\n\n27675.

Why Your California Utility Bill Could Increase Under Trump's Tax Plan\n\n27727. California residents could face higher electricity bills if the Republican version of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill passes, potentially reversing clean energy tax credits established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). An analysis warns household utility bills could increase by 7.2% and business bills by up to 8.5% over the next decade. The proposed legislation includes a tight 60-day window for new energy projects to qualify for tax benefits, which could jeopardize ongoing developments and long-term investments. This is especially concerning as California's electricity costs have already skyrocketed\u2014up 67% in some areas\u2014largely due to wildfire mitigation efforts. Additionally, the bill's changes could lead to job losses and economic slowdowns. Governor Gavin Newsom has responded with strong opposition, even suggesting withholding federal tax payments, citing the state's $83 billion tax surplus sent to the federal government. As the Senate prepares to review and possibly amend the reconciliation bill, the future of energy costs and infrastructure in California remains uncertain.\n\n27728. 'Unprecedented' Private School Voucher Tax Credit in Trump's Megabill\n\n27729. President Trump's newly enacted \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" introduces a significant and controversial provision: a dollar-for-dollar federal tax credit for donations to private school voucher programs, with no budgetary cap. The provision, deemed unprecedented by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), significantly increases incentives for such donations while reducing tax benefits for other charitable contributions. The tax credit supports donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs), which fund private K-12 education, including religious and homeschooling expenses. This aligns with the administration's goal of universal school choice, echoed in the conservative Project 2025 agenda. While the bill initially included a capital gains tax avoidance measure for donors of appreciated assets, that element was removed from the final legislation due to criticism and budget impact concerns. Nonetheless, the bill is estimated by the National Education Association (NEA) to cost the federal government at least $25 billion annually. States can choose whether to participate, and many Democratic-majority states are expected to opt out. Critics argue the tax credit acts as a taxpayer-funded subsidy for private education at the expense of public schools. The bill overall is projected to raise national debt by $3 trillion over the next decade and makes temporary provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent.\n\n27730. 3 things to know about school choice in the 'One Big, Beautiful Bill'\n\n27731.

'Big Ugly Bill': California's top officials excoriate Trump's big bill while it is debated in Senate\n\n27745. 9 Calif. Republicans in hot seat after consequential health care vote\n\n27746. Nine California House Republicans are under scrutiny for supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" which proposes $800 billion in federal spending cuts, predominantly from Medicaid. Despite representing districts heavily reliant on Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program, Republicans like Reps. David Valadao and Young Kim voted for the bill after previously opposing Medicaid reductions. Both have since attempted to justify their votes, asserting that key vulnerable populations would still be protected and that work requirements introduced in the bill would not unduly harm recipients. The bill mandates 20 hours of work per week or equivalent community service to remain eligible for Medicaid, potentially excluding those unable to meet the threshold. The UC Berkeley Labor Center predicts devastating outcomes in California, including the loss of 217,000 healthcare jobs and Medicaid coverage for up to 3.5 million people. Political backlash has already begun, with groups like Emily\u2019s List targeting four California Republicans ahead of the next midterm elections. Critics say the bill benefits the wealthy at the expense of the poor and accuse the GOP representatives of betraying promises to preserve Medicaid. The bill is headed to the Senate, where it may face resistance, possibly rendering the House vote a politically costly gesture.\n\n27747. GOP voucher plan would divert billions in taxes to private schools\n\n27748. Congressional Republicans, with White House backing, are advocating for a federal tax credit program to bolster school voucher initiatives, potentially diverting billions annually from public funds to private education. The proposed legislation would allow taxpayers to receive a dollar-for-dollar credit for donations to scholarship-granting organizations, a benefit far exceeding existing charitable tax deductions. The initiative, projected to cost $5\u201310 billion annually, aims to expand educational choices by funding vouchers redeemable for private schooling or homeschooling, and is modeled on state programs operating in 21 states. Supporters argue it provides crucial alternatives for students in struggling public schools, promoting \"education freedom.\" Opponents, including a coalition of over 60 education groups, warn the plan would deplete critical public school funding and allow private institutions to selectively admit students. Critics also highlight the tax program\u2019s potential for abuse, including complex schemes involving stock donations to exploit capital gains and credit loopholes, amounting to a significant tax shelter. Despite voter resistance and prior federal pushback, the plan enjoys strong conservative support and could be included in a larger budget reconciliation bill. If enacted, it would represent an unprecedented federal expansion into school voucher schemes, reshaping the education funding landscape.\n\n27749. One Big Beautiful Bill Act\n\n27750.

Here\u2019s the clean workflow: 1. **Create a new branch for your idea:** ```bash git checkout -b experiment-branch-name ``` Replace `experiment-branch-name` with something meaningful like `feature-x-test` or `try-new-ui`. 2. **Work on your changes freely.** Commit, test, delete, or revert as needed \u2014 without messing up the main codebase. 3. **If it works:** Merge it back into `main` or your main dev branch: ```bash git checkout main git merge experiment-branch-name ``` 4. **If it sucks:** Just delete the branch: ```bash git branch -D experiment-branch-name ``` This way, your main branch stays clean and you can experiment as much as you want without consequences.\n\n27775.

You\u2019re seeing **\u201cAlready up to date.\u201d** because all the commits from `exp` are already integrated into `main`\u2014even if the files look different\u2014so Git doesn\u2019t see anything new to merge \ue200cite\ue202turn0search0\ue201. Here\u2019s what likely happened: - You created `exp` from `main`. - You made changes in `exp` and committed them. - Somehow, later, those commits made it into `main` already\u2014either via another merge, rebase, cherry-pick, or push. - As a result, Git now recognizes the `exp` commits as ancestors of `main`, so merging does nothing.\n\n### \u2705 How to verify and fix this 1. **Check commit history:** ```bash git log --graph --oneline --decorate main exp ``` This will show if `exp` and `main` share the same commits. 2. **Show commits unique to `exp`:** ```bash git log main..exp ``` If there's no output, everything in `exp` is already in `main`. 3. **Show commits unique to `main`:** ```bash git log exp..main ``` You\u2019ll likely see the work from `exp` already applied to `main`.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Use cases: - If you want to continue new work from `exp`, **create a fresh branch**: ```bash git checkout exp git checkout -b exp-next ``` - If you want to bring in changes from `exp` and they're not in `main`, ensure you're merging the correct branch or commit (e.g., `exp` instead of a branch that already merged them).\n\n### TL;DR Git says \"Already up to date.\" exactly when **there are no new commits** to merge. So based on that message, your `exp` branch\u2019s commits are already part of the `main` branch\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it visually. Let me know if you need help distinguishing which branch actually contains your new work!\n\n27836.

Chris Livingston has signed a fully guaranteed one-year, $2.3 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks, marking his third consecutive year on a guaranteed NBA deal. Initially a controversial decision, Livingston left the University of Kentucky after his freshman season, where he averaged 6.3 points per game, to enter the 2023 NBA Draft. Despite being selected last, 58th overall, by the Bucks, he has managed remarkable financial and professional growth. His performances in the G League and the NBA Summer League have impressed the Bucks' management, prompting them to invest confidently in his potential. Represented by Rich Paul and Klutch Sports, Livingston has now earned over $5 million early in his career. While some Kentucky fans had hoped to see him develop further under Coach John Calipari, the move to the pros has proven advantageous. His athleticism, length, and ability to stretch the floor have been pivotal in establishing his value in the NBA.\n\n27955. Report: Bucks bringing back F Chris Livingston\n\n27956. The Milwaukee Bucks are re-signing forward Chris Livingston to a one-year, $2.3 million guaranteed contract after waiving him earlier in July to avoid a previously scheduled contract guarantee for his third NBA season. Originally selected by the Bucks in the second round of the 2023 NBA Draft out of Kentucky, Livingston had initially signed a record $7.7 million four-year deal for a second-round pick, with the first two years fully guaranteed. The 21-year-old has appeared in 42 regular-season games over two seasons with the Bucks, posting modest averages of 1.3 points and 1.3 rebounds per game in limited minutes. Currently participating in the Las Vegas Summer League, Livingston has shown improved performance, averaging 20 points and 5.3 rebounds while shooting 50% from the field in the first three games. He also played parts of two seasons with the Wisconsin Herd, the Bucks' G League affiliate, averaging 15.7 points and 7.4 rebounds per game.\n\n27957. Rookie Cam Matthews brings a little fight to summer league and gets a contract with Houston Rockets\n\n27958. Cam Matthews, an undrafted rookie from Mississippi State, made a strong impression during the Houston Rockets' NBA Summer League game by getting into a physical altercation with Clippers forward Trentyn Flowers, a moment that was met with amusement by coach Ime Udoka and teammate Amen Thompson. This tenacity exemplified the Rockets' competitive culture and earned Matthews a contract with the team. On Sunday, the Rockets waived guard Nate Williams and signed Matthews to an Exhibit 10 contract, a non-guaranteed deal often used to audition players for a two-way roster spot. Matthews, who excelled defensively in college and led Mississippi State in all-time steals, will compete for a place on the team in training camp. Though he struggled with outside shooting, his versatility, size, and defensive prowess make him a promising developmental player, likely suited for time in the G League. The Rockets, still needing to sign at least one more player to meet the 14-player minimum, seem to value Matthews' defensive skill set and high basketball IQ as they continue to build a competitive roster.\n\n27959.

Mac McClung made history by winning his third consecutive NBA slam dunk contest during the All-Star Weekend. Known for his spectacular dunking skills despite limited NBA playing time, McClung delivered a perfect score on all four of his dunks, including an impressive leap over a car and a jump over 6ft 11in Evan Mobley. His All-Star performance winnings of $310,000 nearly triple his career NBA earnings of $132,101. McClung is primarily a G League player, where he averages 24.5 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists for the Osceola Magic. He currently holds a two-way contract with the Orlando Magic that could eventually increase his NBA earnings beyond his dunk contest winnings. Despite his thoughts of potentially stepping back from future contests, McClung remains appreciative of his opportunities and success in the slam dunk contest.\n\n27981. Scoot Henderson Thinks He Should Go Number One\n\n27982. Scoot Henderson, the 19-year-old star of the G League Ignite, is a top prospect for the June 2023 NBA draft, aiming to be picked first despite the hype surrounding other talents like French center Victor Wembanyama and Alabama forward Brandon Miller. Henderson spent the last two years with the Ignite, foregoing college to play professionally and prepare for the NBA. Recently, Henderson's season was cut short to ensure he remains healthy for pre-draft workouts. While skeptics highlight his height and shooting concerns, supporters praise his explosiveness and leadership. Henderson hails from a family of athletes and is backed by his siblings in managing his career. His performance against top competition, including a notable face-off with Wembanyama, showcased his potential, making him a strong contender for the number one pick.\n\n27983. Syracuse men's basketball: Orange alums Buddy Boeheim, Elijah Hughes sign new NBA deals\n\n27984. Two former Syracuse Orange men's basketball players, Buddy Boeheim and Elijah Hughes, have secured new NBA contracts. Boeheim signed an Exhibit 10 contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder while Hughes signed a similar contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Exhibit 10 contracts are one-year, non-guaranteed deals which can be converted into two-way contracts, allowing players to split time between the NBA and its G-League affiliates. Elijah Hughes, a 2020 second-round pick, has played for teams including the New Orleans Pelicans, Utah Jazz, and Portland Trail Blazers. He averaged 16.3 points and 4.6 rebounds per game during his time at Syracuse. Buddy Boeheim, an undrafted player from 2022, previously played for the Detroit Pistons and their G-League team. He averaged 19.2 points per game in his final college season. Additionally, several other Syracuse alums are in the NBA or seeking to join. This includes Cole Swider with the Indiana Pacers, Jesse Edwards with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Judah Mintz with the Philadelphia 76ers, and Jerami Grant with the Portland Trail Blazers. Former Orange player Oshae Brissett is currently a free agent after his stint with the Boston Celtics.\n\n27985. Lakers se refuerzan con dos jugadores con contrato 'Exhibit 10\u2032\n\n27986.

LeBron James approves Bronny's move to G League after son is called 'worst pick' following LA Lakers start\n\n27994. Despite a promising start to the season for the Los Angeles Lakers, they plan to move Bronny James to the G League. Bronny has played only one game, recording one assist and no points. The decision follows criticism of his selection as the 55th draft pick due to underwhelming college stats. NBA commentator Skip Bayless announced the move via Twitter, suggesting Bronny would join the G League after a five-game road trip.

El art\u00edculo analiza la creciente y compleja din\u00e1mica de traspasos entre la NBA y la Euroliga, donde el talento fluye constantemente entre ambas ligas. Jugadores como Kendrick Nunn, Vasilije Micic o Sasha Vezenkov han dejado la NBA buscando estabilidad y protagonismo en Europa, logrando contratos hist\u00f3ricos y roles estelares en equipos como Panathinaikos y Olympiacos. En sentido inverso, figuras como Nigel Hayes-Davis y Guerschon Yabusele han apostado por regresar a la NBA pese a perder parte de sus contratos europeos, con la esperanza de consolidarse en la mejor liga del mundo. Esta situaci\u00f3n genera una incertidumbre constante para los equipos europeos, que deben anticiparse a salidas imprevistas y ofrecer contratos millonarios por jugadores cuyo rendimiento est\u00e1 por ver. El caso de Jonas Valanciunas ilustra esta tensi\u00f3n: tras sonar para regresar a Europa y firmar con el Panathinaikos, ha sido retenido por los Nuggets al no poder cortar unilateralmente su contrato. La NBA, con una posible expansi\u00f3n a 32 equipos, parece absorber cada vez m\u00e1s talento, mientras la Euroliga se esfuerza por retenerlo y mantener su nivel competitivo.\n\n28028.

NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo on the 'life-changing money' he just helped some of his teammates make\n\n28044. In their recent NBA Cup victory, the Milwaukee Bucks secured significant prize money for all their players, including three players on two-way contracts: Liam Robbins, Stanley Umude, and Ryan Rollins. These two-way contract players, earning $578,577 before taxes, received $257,485 each in prize money, representing a 44.5% increase on their base salaries. NBA superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo highlighted the importance of the prize money for these teammates, referring to it as \"life-changing money.\" Two-way players generally have non-guaranteed contracts and can be cut at any time, making this unexpected bonus highly impactful. Antetokounmpo emphasized the team's collective goal to win the cup partially to benefit these less financially secure players, showcasing the significance of the achievement beyond just the victory itself.\n\n28045. Can WNBA Players Dress Their Way to Pay Equity?\n\n28046. The WNBA is leveraging fashion to draw attention and financial support to women's basketball, addressing the gender pay gap. Caitlin Clark's high-fashion outfit at the WNBA Draft symbolized this movement. Players such as Angel Reese, A'ja Wilson, and Breanna Stewart are now considered fashion icons, using their style to attract media and brand deals. While the average WNBA salary is significantly lower than the NBA, such fashion statements can garner sponsorships and elevate player profiles. Publicists and stylists are pivotal, aiding players in capitalizing on this trend. Collaborations with brands like Skims, Revolve, and New Balance are already resulting from this strategy, suggesting a potential for financial and professional growth for women's basketball athletes.\n\n28047. LeBron's Team USA NBA earnings compared to Team USA women's WNBA earnings show staggering financial disparity between Olympic basketball squads\n\n28048. The financial disparity between Team USA's men's and women's basketball teams is stark. The men's team, composed of NBA players like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Steph Curry, has collectively earned approximately $2.5 billion. In contrast, the women's team, featuring WNBA players such as Brittney Griner and Diana Taurasi, has only managed to earn $9.3 million collectively. LeBron James alone has a career earning nearly $480 million, outpacing the total earnings of the entire women's team. This highlights significant gender disparities in professional basketball earnings. The gap is partly attributed to the WNBA's lower revenue, shorter season, and fewer teams. However, there is optimism for change with new media rights deals and the potential for renegotiated collective bargaining agreements, driven by rising stars like Caitlin Clark. These could lead to better financial opportunities for women\u2019s basketball players in the near future.\n\n28049. Caitlin Clark will earn 2% of the median NBA salary. Is that as ridiculous as it sounds?\n\n28050. Caitlin Clark, the biggest star in women's college basketball, signed a contract with the WNBA worth $338,000 over four years, a stark contrast to NBA rookie Victor Wembanyama's $55 million contract. This issue of salary disparity highlights significant inequality, with the WNBA's median salary being merely 2% of that in the NBA. Despite this, there has been progress compared to earlier eras, such as Diana Taurasi's initial $40,000 salary. WNBA players often play overseas during the offseason due to better pay. The NBA's higher revenues allow for more significant player earnings, further exacerbating the disparity. However, the WNBA has achieved some advancements, including charter flights for players. With potential changes in the league's revenue distribution and TV rights deal nearing renegotiation, there's hope for better salaries in the future. Clark's significant off-court earnings and sponsorships indicate growing commercial interest in women's basketball, which may eventually lead to substantial salary improvements.\n\n28051. How Labor Unions Changed Pro Sports\n\n28052. Labor unions profoundly altered professional sports by securing better wages, benefits, and working conditions for athletes, who were once subjected to unfair treatment and inadequate compensation. In the NHL, the formation of the NHLPA in 1967 helped players attain higher salaries and benefits, like pensions and healthcare. MLB players, through the MLBPA and the work of economist Marvin Miller, ended the reserve clause, allowing for free agency and significantly improved wages. NFL players established their union in 1956, resulting in better compensation, injury benefits, and pensions. NBA players, led by Bob Cousy in 1954, formed the NBAPA, gaining several early victories including minimum wages and per diem allowances. Today, players in these leagues earn average salaries ranging from $1.54 million in the NHL to $8.32 million in the NBA. These improvements highlight the unions' pivotal role in transforming professional sports' labor standards.\n\n28053. NFL vs. NBA player salaries: Who earns more?\n\n28054. While both the NFL and NBA dominate American sports, NBA players earn significantly more on an individual basis than NFL players. Despite the NFL generating higher total revenue, disparities in player salaries arise due to differing roster sizes, revenue-sharing models, and the drawing power of individual superstars. NBA teams have smaller rosters, allowing for a larger salary share per player. Additionally, the NBA\u2019s structure facilitates higher contracts for its top players, often resulting in record-breaking deals. In contrast, the NFL\u2019s larger rosters and more evenly distributed salary caps limit the earning potential of individual players. Ultimately, the NBA outpaces the NFL in per-player salaries, firmly establishing its dominance on the salary scoreboard.\n\n28055. NBA salary cap\n\n28056.

What Is Donald Trump's Net Worth and What Are His Assets?\n\n28115. Determining Donald Trump\u2019s exact net worth has been fraught with contention. While Trump has claimed his wealth exceeds $10 billion, Bloomberg valued it at $7.7 billion in 2024, and Forbes put it at $6.7 billion for the same year. Trump's riches primarily derive from real estate development and his ownership in the Trump Media and Technology Group, which runs Truth Social. However, his net worth has faced scrutiny due to accusations by New York Attorney General Letitia James that Trump inflated asset values to gain favorable loans. He was also convicted on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records in 2024. Trump has faced accusations of exaggerating his wealth and lacks detailed public financial disclosures. His businesses are privately held, making accurate valuation difficult. Despite six bankruptcy filings by his businesses, Trump has never filed for personal bankruptcy. Controversy surrounding his wealth and financial practices continues.\n\n28116. Welcome To Donald Trump's Plutocracy\n\n28117. Donald Trump has been elected for a second term with significant support from working-class voters, yet his actions during the transition period suggest his priorities lie with the wealthy. Trump's incoming Cabinet and administration members have a combined net worth of around $340 billion, making it the richest in history. Prominent appointments include billionaire Elon Musk and other billionaires like Doug Burgum for Interior secretary, Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary, Howard Lutnick for Commerce secretary, and Linda McMahon for Education secretary. Despite his populist rhetoric, Trump's policies favor the rich, such as planned tax cuts funded by tariffs that likely impact ordinary Americans. Critics argue that his administration will be rife with conflicts of interest and will prioritize the interests of the wealthy over those of the middle and working classes.\n\n28118.

Donald Trump inheritance amount\n\n28163. Trump gives nepo babies a big beautiful tax boost\n\n28164. Donald Trump's newly passed tax bill significantly raises the federal estate tax exemption threshold, allowing individuals to leave up to $15 million ($30 million for couples) tax-free to heirs. Previously, the 2001 exemption was only $675,000, highlighting how the affluent have effectively influenced tax policy over the years. Though estate taxes contribute less than $40 billion to federal revenue and affect fewer than 1% of households, the policy shift has broader implications. It amplifies generational wealth inequality, concentrating inheritance among the richest families, while the bottom 50% of households now hold only about 2.5% of national wealth. With a projected $124 trillion in wealth expected to be passed down over the coming 25 years, this tax revision disproportionately benefits the wealthiest 10% of Americans, who already own two-thirds of the nation's wealth. This move, while financially insignificant for the government, further entrenches socioeconomic divisions and raises concerns over rising inequality amid fiscal challenges and generational wealth transfer.\n\n28165.

New York tax authorities investigating Trump fraud allegations\n\n28185. New York state tax authorities are investigating allegations of tax fraud by Donald Trump following a New York Times report. The report claimed Trump, along with his siblings, engaged in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s to take control of their father Fred Trump's real estate empire. The New York Times\u2019 investigation, based on numerous interviews and over 100,000 documents, revealed Trump received over $413 million equivalent through various revenue streams set up by his father. This contradicts Trump's long-standing portrayal of himself as a self-made millionaire. The investigation alleged Trump and his siblings paid only $52.2m in taxes on over $1bn of inherited wealth, far below the required gift tax rates. Trump's lawyer denied any fraud, labelling the allegations as false and defamatory. Tax authorities are now reviewing these claims, which could result in civil fines if proven.\n\n28186.

A New York state appeals court has ruled that former President Donald Trump can sue his niece, Mary Trump, over providing the New York Times with information for its 2018 Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into his finances and alleged tax evasion. The court determined there is a substantial legal basis for Donald Trump's claim that Mary Trump breached confidentiality provisions of a 2001 settlement regarding the estate of Fred Trump Sr. However, the court suggested that Trump may only be entitled to minimal damages, rather than the $100 million he sought. Mary Trump's lawyers argued that the lawsuit is a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) aimed at silencing critics and infringing on free speech. The court's decision also upheld a prior ruling that dismissed Trump's claims against the New York Times and required him to cover their legal fees. Mary Trump previously revealed her role as a source for the Times in her 2020 book, \"Too Much and Never Enough.\"\n\n28199. Donald Trump's Niece Challenges His Debate Claim That He Didn't Receive $400 Million Allowance from Father\n\n28200. During the September 10 debate against Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump denied claims that he received $400 million from his father. His niece, Mary Trump, refuted his statement, asserting that Donald was indeed gifted and loaned $413 million over Fred C. Trump Sr.'s lifetime. Mary critiqued Donald further, noting his six bankruptcies and the bank putting him on a $425,000 monthly allowance as a result of his financial failures. A 2018 New York Times report corroborates Mary's claims, stating Trump received the equivalent of $413 million from his father's estate and alleged involvement in tax evasion. Despite Trump's denial and his spokesperson's dismissal of Mary's claims, her statements add to the scrutiny of Trump's financial history and business ethics. Mary has been a vocal critic of her uncle, previously publishing a book detailing his rise to power and their family dynamics, and continues to speak out against him.\n\n28201. Trump Insists He Lost $1 Billion on Purpose\n\n28202. The New York Times reported that Donald Trump inherited $400 million from his father, mainly through dubious tax practices, and lost over a billion dollars in a decade, particularly in 1989, 1990, and 1991. Trump claimed that these losses were intentional due to tax benefits in real estate during that time. His tax strategies allowed him to avoid paying taxes for eight out of ten years. Despite defending his financial acumen on Twitter, reporters revealed most of his losses resulted from poor business decisions. Fred Trump, his father, contrastedly reported substantial income, excluding a loss of $15 million from investing in Donald's project. The mainstream media and outlets like Fox and Friends responded divergently to the revelations, with some praising Trump's resilience.\n\n28203.

A fabricated nation called the United States of Kailasa, founded by fugitive Indian Hindu guru Nithyananda, has been attempting to acquire Indigenous land in Latin America, particularly in Bolivia. Presenting itself falsely as a sovereign state, Kailasa offered substantial sums to multiple Indigenous groups in the Bolivian Amazon for leases on their ancestral lands, with contracts proposing 1,000-year terms and full sovereignty over large territories. These agreements included obligations for Indigenous communities to defend Kailasa\u2019s legitimacy in international forums. The Bolivian media exposed the scam, revealing violations of national laws and exploitation of vulnerable Indigenous representatives. The Bolivian government later denied diplomatic ties with Kailasa and expelled 20 foreign nationals linked to the group. Despite public scrutiny and condemnation, questions remain about how Kailasa managed to infiltrate these communities.

When people get caught stealing and get a misdemeanor, it'll be on their record and they'll have trouble finding jobs in the future \u2013 ultimately resulting in an endless cycle of theft because they weren\u2019t able to get an occupation because they were struggling one time. Refute: (what would the other team say) stealing is stealing and you will be punished no matter what. It is unethical. Terrible for the economy and businesses Counter: Point 2: (possible) over criminalizing has a significant economic cost, and there are other crimes that are more major and \u201cimportant\u201d that should be taken care of instead of petty theft \u2013 $750M can be used towards rehabilitation or other more major issues (homelessness, etc.) Sources: #6 Refute: (what would the other team say) Shoplifting negatively affects businesses and the economy already, so putting them in jail will put an end to shoplifting, we would rather use that money to put them in jail to stop shoplifting all together Counter: This money can be better spent, with more effective strategies to reduce crime, such as investment in education and job training programs, and rehabilitation facilities. Closing: Other teams points safety Counter Arguments for other team: (utilize pathos) People are born into different backgrounds \u2013 some are more privileged than others, resulting in variations of economic backgrounds Some people cannot afford simple basic human necessities which ultimately leads to theft for survival Maybe a natural disaster like an earthquake happens, tons of people have lost everything and need necessities to survive.

Because state law holds that stealing merchandise\n\n28323. California increased penalties for some drug and theft crimes. Here's how the law is working\n\n28324. Five months after the implementation of California's Proposition 36, which increases penalties for repeat drug and theft offenses, there has been uneven application across counties. The law permits repeat petty thefts (under $950) and drug possession to be charged as felonies, with the goal of deterring crime and encouraging treatment over incarceration through a new treatment-mandated felony category. However, only a small number of such cases have led to treatment, and the total filed cases remain a minor share of overall criminal filings. San Francisco, for instance, has filed relatively few cases, citing crime declines and policy changes. District Attorneys vary widely in their application of past conviction timeframes and discretion over prosecuting low-level thefts, sparking criticism about potential overreach and neglect of treatment infrastructure. Some counties, like Stanislaus, face challenges reaching treatment capacity, though officials insist efforts are ongoing. Critics argue Prop 36 promotes incarceration over rehabilitation, while supporters stress deterrence. Funding remains a major concern, as the law increases incarceration costs without providing resources for treatment expansion. Public defenders and some legal experts have expressed disappointment with the rollout, fearing it undermines years of justice reform progress.\n\n28325. Some judges undermine S.F.'s tougher crime law, DA says\n\n28326. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, Police Chief William Scott, and local business leaders commended tougher laws and increased funding aimed at reducing retail theft during a panel convened by the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. They highlighted the passage of Proposition 36, which increases punishments for theft and drug possession, making some former misdemeanors felonies, and recent state funding. The proposition, supported by nearly 64% of voters, has led to collaborative task forces between police and prosecutors to address theft and reselling stolen goods. However, Jenkins expressed frustration with judges undermining the law by reducing felony charges to misdemeanors, despite the qualifications of such charges under Prop. 36. She emphasized challenges posed by judges with far-left ideologies. Enhanced surveillance efforts, including more cameras and police drones, have improved the process of securing plea deals and jury convictions for retail theft.\n\n28327. Busted thieves baffled by 'new laws' in California that make shoplifting a felony, police video shows\n\n28328. In California, new laws under Proposition 36 are now treating certain shoplifting incidents as felonies. This shocked an alleged shoplifter arrested in Seal Beach when she realized she might face serious charges. Previously, a 2014 law categorized thefts involving less than $950 in goods as misdemeanors, but the rise in retail theft led voters to support tougher measures. In a video released by the Seal Beach Police Department, three women are shown stealing over $600 worth of items from Ulta Beauty. The police stated their commitment to tackling Organized Retail Theft, highlighting the new proposition's role in strengthening enforcement.\n\n28329. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signs retail crime bills in scramble to tackle rampant shoplifting\n\n28330. California Governor Gavin Newsom signed ten bills into law aimed at combatting retail theft, addressing rising shoplifting, theft from vehicles, organized theft, and the resale of stolen goods. This legislative move follows the high-profile arrest of Michelle Mack, who led the \"California Girls\" crime ring that stole millions from cosmetic chains Ulta and Sephora. The new laws include increased penalties for perpetrators, particularly those involved in organized crime rings, enhancing sentences based on the value of stolen goods. Store owners and critics have long called for stricter measures, arguing that California's previous penalties were too lenient. Although these new laws present a firmer stance against retail crime, doubts remain whether they can mitigate the damage already inflicted by the rising crime rates, which have severely impacted communities and businesses, especially in the Bay Area.\n\n28331. California voters pass initiative to make some shoplifting and drug offenses felonies\n\n28332. Brazen Target shopper steals $60k worth of items at self-checkout - workers grew suspicious due to her payment method\n\n28333. Aziza Graves, 43, was arrested for stealing $60,000 worth of items from Target in San Francisco over several visits between October 2020 and November 2021. She would leave a single coin or bill at self-checkout before fleeing. Police tracked her activities and observed her selling the stolen goods. Graves faces one felony count of grand theft, 52 misdemeanor counts of petty theft, and additional charges from another theft at Abercrombie and Fitch. Sentencing is scheduled for May 24, where she could face up to three years in state prison. This arrest coincides with new legislation aimed at addressing rampant retail theft in California, including a bill proposed by Assembly Member James C. Ramos that could impose harsher penalties on repeat offenders. Shoplifting rates in California have surged since the pandemic, prompting measures to combat organized retail crime.\n\n28334. thread_6879439a7e1080048bc94f5830bf8cfe\n\n28335.

NOA NO vote on this measure means: Punishment for drug and theft crimes would remain the same. ARGUMENTS PROProp. 36 makes California communities safer by addressing rampant theft and drug trafficking. It toughens penalties for fentanyl and drug traffickers and \"smash-and-grabs\" while holding repeat offenders accountable. It targets serial thieves and encourages treatment for those addicted to drugs, using a balanced approach to fix loopholes in current laws.CONDon't be fooled.

This marks a departure from previous criminal justice reforms aimed at reducing prison overcrowding and prioritizing alternatives to incarceration. The ballot measure was supported by retail corporations and law enforcement to address shoplifting, property crime, and open-air drug use, despite opposition from civil rights groups who argue that it will increase prison populations and not address underlying social issues. Critics highlight a lack of funding for treatment programs and fear the return of punitive measures will exacerbate homelessness, addiction, and mental health problems. Concerns are also raised about potential jail overcrowding and increased fatalities in custody.

SUMMARYPut on the Ballot by Petition Signatures Allows felony charges for possessing certain drugs and for thefts under $950, if defendant has two prior drug or theft convictions. Fiscal Impact: State criminal justice costs likely ranging from several tens of millions of dollars to the low hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Local criminal justice costs likely in the tens of millions of dollars annually. Supporters: Crime Victims United of California; California District Attorneys Association; Family Business Association of California Opponents: Diana Becton, District Attorney Contra Costa County; Crime Survivors for Safety and Justice WHAT YOUR VOTE MEANS YESA YES vote on this measure means: People convicted of certain drug or theft crimes could receive increased punishment, such as longer prison sentences. In certain cases, people who possess illegal drugs would be required to complete treatment or serve up to three years in prison. NOA NO vote on this measure means: Punishment for drug and theft crimes would remain the same. ARGUMENTS PROProp. 36 makes California communities safer by addressing rampant theft and drug trafficking. It toughens penalties for fentanyl and drug traffickers and \"smash-and-grabs\" while holding repeat offenders accountable. It targets serial thieves and encourages treatment for those addicted to drugs, using a balanced approach to fix loopholes in current laws.CONDon't be fooled. Proposition 36 will lead to more crime, not less. It reignites the failed war on drugs, makes simple drug possession a felony, and wastes billions on prisons, while slashing crucial funding for victims, crime prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. This puts prisons first and guts treatment. Vote No. Read this and create a short argument for us\n\n28372. 960be57cbc1b67cb-SJC\n\n28373.

Proposition 36, passed recently, aims to impose stricter penalties on repeat offenders, potentially charging misdemeanors as felonies, but its long-term effectiveness remains uncertain. Public officials and advocates recognize the need for a balanced approach that addresses both enforcement and supportive resources for vulnerable populations.\n\n28413. Tough-on-crime laws are winning at the ballot box\n\n28414. Despite declining crime rates since 2021, Americans are leaning towards tougher criminal justice policies. Proposition 36 in California, passed with over 70% voter support, toughens penalties for drug and theft-related crimes. This marks a significant shift for the state known for progressive reforms, indicating a nationwide backlash against criminal justice reform. Similarly, Colorado approved Proposition 128, requiring violent crime convicts to serve 85% of their sentence before parole eligibility. These trends suggest increasing public support for stricter crime measures, potentially reversing decades of reform aimed at reducing prison populations. Law-and-order campaigns and media coverage may contribute to public perceptions of rising crime, despite statistical evidence to the contrary. The success of these measures reflects broader American sentiment towards crime and punishment, potentially influencing future policies in other states. However, criminal justice reform continues at lower-profile levels, highlighting the ongoing struggle between tough-on-crime laws and reform efforts.\n\n28415. Californians' crime concerns put pressure on criminal justice reform and progressive DAs\n\n28416. Californians overwhelmingly pass anti-crime Proposition 36 measure that Dem Gov. Gavin Newsom strongly opposed\n\n28417. California voters approved Proposition 36 with 70.6% support, despite opposition from Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. The measure, aimed at more severely punishing certain crimes, authorizes felony charges for drug possession (including fentanyl) and thefts under $950 if the offender has two prior convictions. It also introduces the \"treatment-mandated felony\" category, allowing drug convictions to be set aside upon completing rehabilitation. Newsom criticized the proposition, likening it to 1980s mass incarceration policies. Supporters argued it would improve residents' quality of life and provide a balanced approach for drug users. Major news outlets projected the measure's victory with 56.6% of ballots counted.\n\n28418. 2014 California Proposition 47\n\n28419. 2012 California Proposition 36\n\n28420.

Roles: Intro: Thavas Point 1: Haley Point 2: Bernice Closing: Anthony Refute: Shawn Opening: (90 secs) Vid: 2 mins Argument (Main): 1 min Huddle: 30 sec Rebuttal: 1 min and half Argument: 1 min Huddle: 30 secs Rebuttal: 1 min and half Closing: 1 min each for both pro and cons Questions: 2 - 5 minutes Point 1: The current solution of theft (prosecution) isn\u2019t the right way to help people in poverty or in need. When people get caught stealing and get a misdemeanor, it'll be on their record and they'll have trouble finding jobs in the future \u2013 ultimately resulting in an endless cycle of theft because they weren\u2019t able to get an occupation because they were struggling one time. Refute: (what would the other team say) stealing is stealing and you will be punished no matter what. It is unethical. Terrible for the economy and businesses Counter: Point 2: (possible) over criminalizing has a significant economic cost, and there are other crimes that are more major and \u201cimportant\u201d that should be taken care of instead of petty theft \u2013 $750M can be used towards rehabilitation or other more major issues (homelessness, etc.) Sources: #6 Refute: (what would the other team say) Shoplifting negatively affects businesses and the economy already, so putting them in jail will put an end to shoplifting, we would rather use that money to put them in jail to stop shoplifting all together Counter: This money can be better spent, with more effective strategies to reduce crime, such as investment in education and job training programs, and rehabilitation facilities. Closing: It allows people to be charged with felonies for petty theft under $950 if they\u2019ve made mistakes in the past. That means someone who stole food twice\u2014maybe because they were homeless or desperate\u2014could face up to 3 years in prison for another small offense. SOLUTION - RULES Tier 1: Basic Necessities (Food, Water, Hygiene) \u2013 Diversion & Support Penalty: No jail time. Mandatory diversion programs, community service, or rehabilitation. Rationale: Criminalizing someone for stealing diapers is unethical. Tier 2: Non-Essential but Low-Value Items (e.g. Clothing, Personal Goods under $500) Penalty: Warning or citation for first-time offenders, misdemeanor for repeat offenses. Rationale: Focus on reform, not punishment. Tier 3: Luxury Items (e.g. Designer bags, tech gadgets, alcohol) Penalty: Misdemeanor with possible community service, fines, or probation. Rationale: These are not survival-driven. Harsher than Tier 2, but still aims to avoid long-term damage like permanent records. Tier 4: High-Value Theft (over $999 or organized retail crime) Penalty: Felony charges Rationale: Large-scale or organized theft causes real harm to the economy and should be treated seriously. What might they say 1. Theft harms small businesses and employees Claim: Shoplifting causes billions in losses, increasing costs for consumers and harming small businesses, some of which are forced to shut down. Example: A small store loses $500 worth of goods each month \u2013 that's rent or wages they can\u2019t pay. Counter: We\u2019re not justifying theft\u2014we\u2019re asking to address root causes to prevent it. Prosecution doesn\u2019t help the business recover. Prevention does: community support, surveillance, and education. 2. Lack of consequences leads to more crime Claim: If people know they won\u2019t be punished, theft will rise. Prosecution deters others. Counter: Harsh punishment hasn\u2019t stopped theft. Addressing poverty, trauma, and desperation reduces repeat offenses more than jail time ever has. Real deterrents are opportunity and support, not fear. 3. Stealing is immoral and unethical, regardless of context Claim: Wrong is wrong. If we excuse theft, we allow breakdown of moral values. Counter: Stealing isn\u2019t right\u2014but criminalizing survival is worse. Ethics must account for circumstance. A mom stealing baby formula is different from a thief selling stolen goods. 4. Public safety is at risk if theft is tolerated Claim: Letting people get away with petty theft emboldens worse behavior. Safety for store workers and citizens is compromised. Counter: No one is saying \u201cget away with it.\u201d We want restorative justice, not permanent damage to someone\u2019s life over $20. Counter Arguments for other team: (utilize pathos) People are born into different backgrounds \u2013 some are more privileged than others, resulting in variations of economic backgrounds Some people cannot afford simple basic human necessities which ultimately leads to theft for survival Maybe a natural disaster like an earthquake happens, tons of people have lost everything and need necessities to survive.

The user wants the curve in the Blender Graph Editor to extend beyond the last keyframe, continuing its trend instead of resetting. They\u2019re using keyframes on Y Location, ending at frame 49 with a value of -5. One option is using the \"Repeat with Offset\" in the F-Curve Modifier, which adds the last keyframe's change to continue the pattern. Another approach is adjusting the Extrapolation Mode setting to \"Cyclic\", but this just loops back to the start, which the user doesn't want.\n\n28500. Exploring Blender Graph Editor options\n\n28501. I\u2019m trying to figure out how to get the curve to continue downward, using the \"Repeat with Offset\" in the F-Curve Modifier. If I choose \"After Mode,\" it will repeat the movement, shifting by the difference between start and end. Alternatively, I can use \"Linear Extrapolation\" to continue the slope of the last segment. If I need the pattern to repeat with an offset, I can also try making it cyclic and adding modifiers. I\u2019ll check out online sources for more clarity on this.\n\n28502.
