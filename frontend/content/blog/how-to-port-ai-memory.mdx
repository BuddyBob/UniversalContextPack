Managing conversations across multiple AI platforms is inefficient by design.

You may build deep context inside ChatGPT, only to switch to Claude for analysis or Gemini for multimodal work. The moment you switch, context and memory is lost. You are introduced to the issue of fragmented memory.

This is not a usability issue. It's an issue that cannot be solved by that AI vendor, and only possible through third party tools. 

**Context Pack solves this by introducing Portable AI Memory.**

## The Problem: AI Resets Constantly

Modern AI systems are powerful, but are only efficient with set context limits. 

Some Problems:

- Memory is isolated to a single Platform
- Context limits like Chat GPT's 32k token limits memory
- Chats become unusable when they exceed chat limits or image uploads

This creates several systemic problems:

- **Lost Context**: Switching tools means starting from zero
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Your history keeps you tied to one platform
- **Inefficiency**: Re-explaining context wastes time and tokens
- **Fragmentation**: AI behaves inconsistently across workflows
- **Unusable Exports**: Chat histories are dumped into massive, unstructured JSON files
- **No Source of Truth**: Businesses cannot reliably personalize AI across teams or users

As a result, AI is fragmented, forgetful, and unreliable as a long-term assistant.

## What Can Change

You should have access to your chats, documents, and preferences. 

The memories and information you share with AI should not only be yours, but also portable, editable, and under your control.

## The Solution: Portable AI Memory

Context Pack creates **Portable AI Memory**.

It converts conversations, documents, and preferences into structured, reusable context that moves with you across AI models and workflows.

Instead of starting from scratch, your AI starts with context.

## What Context Pack Enables

- Carry work, research, and preferences across AI platforms
- Reuse context without re-uploading or re-explaining
- Read and manage extremely large chat export files
- Maintain consistent AI behavior across sessions
- Personalize AI reliably, even at scale

Your AI no longer starts from zero.

## Real-World Use Cases

### For Developers

Maintain technical context across AI coding tools:

```
I am building a Next.js 14 application.
The backend uses Supabase.
Tailwind handles styling.
Here is the current architecture and what we have implemented so far.
```

Reuse this context across debugging, refactoring, and planning sessions without restating it.

### For Researchers

Preserve research continuity:

- Import papers and notes
- Carry literature reviews across models
- Compare outputs from different AIs using the same source context

Context stays consistent while perspectives vary.

### For Content Creators

Maintain creative continuity:

- Store character bios and worldbuilding details
- Preserve tone, voice, and narrative rules
- Move projects between AI platforms without drift

## Security and Control

Context Pack is built with privacy as a baseline:

- End-to-end encryption
- No AI training on user data
- Full user control over deletion and persistence

Your memory belongs to you.

## Why Portable AI Memory Matters

AI tools will continue to multiply.

You're also going to keep feeding AI information.

Without portable memory, users remain trapped in fragmented workflows where context constantly decays. Portable AI Memory is the foundation for AI systems that behave consistently over time.

**Context Pack delivers that foundation.**

## Getting Started

1. Create an account at [context-pack.com](https://context-pack.com)
2. Upload a conversation export or document
3. Generate your context pack
4. Import it into any AI and continue your work
