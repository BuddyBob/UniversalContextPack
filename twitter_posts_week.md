It's compliance, not true data portability.

Context Pack turns it into something you can actually use 🔄

**Post 1 - Weekend Read**
```
Spent my Saturday reading about data portability laws.

GDPR requires data exports, but "machine-readable" ≠ "actually useful"

Context Pack bridges that gap.

Your data should work for you, not just exist in a file.
```

```
Weekend question:

If you could give your AI memory to a different AI platform, which would you choose and why?
