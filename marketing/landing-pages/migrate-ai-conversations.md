# Migrate AI Conversations Between Platforms: The Complete Guide

**Switch AI platforms without losing your conversation history.** Whether you're moving from ChatGPT to Claude, Gemini to ChatGPT, or trying multiple AI assistants, migrate your conversations seamlessly while preserving context and memory.

## Why Migrate AI Conversations Between Platforms?

**The Multi-AI Reality**
- ChatGPT excels at coding and creative writing
- Claude is superior for analysis and long-form content
- Gemini integrates with Google Workspace
- You need the **right AI for each task** - without starting from scratch

**Common Migration Scenarios:**
- 🔄 **Testing different AI platforms** - Find the best fit without losing work
- 💼 **Work requirements change** - Company switches AI tools
- 🚀 **Feature availability** - New features launch on different platforms
- 💰 **Cost optimization** - Balance free tiers and paid subscriptions
- 🔒 **Privacy concerns** - Move to more private AI platforms

## The Challenge: AI Platforms Don't Talk to Each Other

**Current Reality:**
- ❌ ChatGPT memory doesn't transfer to Claude
- ❌ Gemini can't import Claude conversations
- ❌ Each platform uses proprietary export formats
- ❌ Manual copy-paste loses context and structure
- ❌ Starting fresh means re-explaining everything

**You need a universal bridge between AI platforms.**

## How to Migrate AI Conversations (Traditional Methods)

### Method 1: Manual Export + Import (Limited)

**Step 1: Export from Source Platform**
```
ChatGPT: Settings → Data Controls → Export
Claude: Settings → Export Data
Gemini: Google Takeout
```

**Step 2: Extract Key Information**
- Manually read through JSON exports
- Copy important context
- Summarize key points

**Step 3: Paste into New Platform**
- Start new conversation
- Paste context summary
- Hope the AI understands

**Problems:**
- ⏱️ Takes hours for large conversation histories
- 📉 Loses conversation structure and nuance
- 🧠 No automatic context distillation
- 💔 Platform-specific formatting breaks

### Method 2: Browser Extensions

**Available Tools:**
- AI Chat Exporter
- Save My Chatbot
- Retry in Another AI

**Limitations:**
- Usually export to PDF/Markdown only
- Can't recreate AI memory context
- Platform-specific compatibility
- No intelligent processing

### Method 3: Third-Party AI Workspaces

**Tools like Magai, LibreChat:**
- Centralized interface for multiple AIs
- **BUT:** Still doesn't migrate *existing* conversation history
- Requires using their platform ongoing

## Solution: Context Pack - Universal AI Migration Platform

**[Context Pack](https://context-pack.com)** is the **only tool built specifically for migrating AI conversations between any platforms** while preserving context and memory.
