# Email Configuration Update

## Issue Fixed
Updated email configuration to use verified domain `context-pack.com` instead of restricted test email address.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Code Update (`simple_backend.py`)
- Updated `send_email_notification()` function to use `noreply@context-pack.com` as the from address
- Changed from dynamic `EMAIL_FROM` environment variable to hardcoded verified domain
- Improved email display name to "Universal Context Pack"

### 2. Environment Configuration (`railway.env`)
- Updated `EMAIL_FROM=noreply@context-pack.com` (was `onboarding@resend.dev`)
- Now uses your verified domain for all outgoing emails

## Verification Steps

1. **Domain Status**: ✅ `context-pack.com` is verified in Resend dashboard
2. **Email Address**: ✅ Using `noreply@context-pack.com` from verified domain
3. **API Key**: ✅ `RESEND_API_KEY` is configured in environment

## Testing
To test the email functionality:

```bash
# Make a request that triggers email notification
# The email will now be sent from noreply@context-pack.com
```

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the updated backend code
2. Update Railway environment variables with the new `EMAIL_FROM` value
3. Test email notifications to confirm they work without restrictions

## Note
- No more "testing emails to your own address" restriction
- Can now send emails to any user who completes a job
- Professional email address using your verified domain
